8nmmrf	Hey ladies! So I'm curious as to what kind of porn you watch. I think it is understood that guys watch stuff that is generally pretty unrealistic and hardcore. Do you watch the same things? Or do you prefer something else? Send me your favorite gifs and we can discuss!	?

8nmmqo	So today I was thinking about LeBron. How in the world is a 6‚Äô8 260 lb man with calves bigger than my torso created? Having that body is one thing, but being able to fly through the air like ET and make any shot on the court with that body is another. It makes me wonder if LeBron‚Äôs dad had a similar potential, only untapped. Delonte West was good but his potential....Shit just amazes me. Looking forward to the game tonight and seeing Lebron trot up and down the court. I want you guys to really focus in on how massive LeBron is tonight, really settle down and take it in. Take it in really deep. We don‚Äôt deserve to witness such a massive organism cut so swiftly through the atmosphere - have a great night	?

8nmmrg	So I've had the phone over a week now and I am starting to question...Is it worth having the Adaptive Brightness switched on or not? Does it interfere with your display? Does it make a difference on battery life?

8nmmq2	I went to MEPs today, doctor didn't approve me and scheduled a consult to review an ankle surgery I had 8 years ago. This is very frustrating because it took nearly 2 months for them to even allow me to go to MEPs \(surgeon general approved me to physical\). Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar thing happen. Pretty bummed out because I was set to leave end of June and now, at the rate I've seen them move, I don't think that will happen. 	?

8nmmqz	So with BfA right around the corner, I cant help but wonder why we have not really seen a lot in terms of new abilities yet? I know this is a dead horse at this point, but maybe, just MAYBE the new abilities are rolled into the "Heart of Azeroth" \(the legendary necklace replacing artifact weapons, for those not into the beta\).                                                                                                             What do you guys think? Wishful thinking or actual possibility? I mean it would make sense since Azerite is basically artifact power and the fact that it is a necklace and not a weapon slot would work in the sense that your progression would count towards all 3 specs.  	?
