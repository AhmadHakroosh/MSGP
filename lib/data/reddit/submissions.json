I left all of my friends and family behind, really excited to meet all these great new people and start on this new chapter of my life. The first half of this semester was rather depressing and lonely for me; I was really struggling to make the meaningful and close friendships that I had envisioned. Sure, people are really nice here and all, but I felt like all of the relationships I made were just superficial and barely at the surface of the type of friendships I needed. However, now that its toward the end of the semester I've had a better time cultivating friendships and the loneliness isn't as bad. However, I think what's really been hurting me is that I've been constantly comparing my social life to that of my boyfriend's. He's in the military, stationed on a base, and it seems like every day he's with all of these different friends, doing all of these really cool things! And though I feel happy for him, I just can't help but to feel jealous and sad that I'm all cooped up in my dorm room for the majority of the day. I feel like he's out living this really great life that's just a lot different than mine, and I'm just here, not really doing much. Sometimes I feel like by constantly comparing my life to his, I'm just hindering my own self growth. I know a lot of college freshman must feel the same way I do and all, I shouldn't have to feel like I'm \"behind\" or some sort of loser for being in a different place in my life. But every day this is something that weighs on me, and nobody has any idea. Any thoughts or advice maybe? thanks.",

His songs have lyrics that cover religion, abstract poetry, break up, death, life, love, the stories of himself, the stories of others, almost everything. It took until the 80's and the rise of rap to create a set lyrical styles that he hadn't touched. That was because it was almost exclusively geared around the experience of being black and living in an urban environment. He's covered so much ground his time that it's hard to find songwriters that have touched on ground that he hasn't. I'm not saying that lyrics since Dylan are crap, just that it's hard to think of lyricists who've found ways of writing out their experiences and thoughts on the world in a totally fresh way. Of course no music exists in a vacuum, it's just if I go back and listen to Dylan I can hear strains of his DNA in a lot of present day lyricists. The few who I've noticed that are few of his \"genes\" are artists like Joanna Newsome, Isaac Brock, and Jeff Mangum. And of course a majority of rappers. People who's view of the world is completely unique in their music. What about you guys? Do you agree or disagree? What are some of your favorite lyricists that have escaped Dylan's shadow? ",

I have a busy job that demands a lot of me and I end up working 10-16 hours days (and I work remotely from home) so I don't get much exercise, but decided to fix my energy intake instead of adding a lot of physical exercise. I lost the first 15 kilos easily (I was close to 130kg at the time) but then I stalled. I slowly got to where I am now, at 105kg, but can't drop any further.My diet is mostly eating bread+meat+cheese (lots of protein+fiber) in the morning for about 300kcal. Then warm food for about 300-400kcal (right now it's been egg noodles, vegetables (carrot,cauliflower,broccoli) and chicken (breast)) and then in the night some meat and veggies (usually tomatoes) for 150-300kcal. So daily I go for about 900-1300kcal depending on day, definitely under 1500kcal.I've started walking daily since I don't get much exercise from commutes, doing 45-90 minute walks etc. My fitness app claims I spend on average about 400kcal on these walks.I also drink a lot of water (plus coffee and tea, no sugar). So my intake is, after what I've spent walking, around 500-900kcal a day. I weight myself every morning (after visiting the bathroom) and my weight stays the same. Occasionally it rises a bit, then goes back to being where it is (105.7kg this morning).What to do? I guess my body has cut down a lot of stuff I'd normally spend idle calories on (I am usually feeling really cold even though the temperature is normal or even towards hot (22-28°C)), I sleep okish amounts (6-9 hours a night) but I am quite tired a lot of the time.

Of course tempo affects these things as well, but...what do you think? I know personal expression wasn't an ideal in the era, but when I hear the minor-key sad music, it feels otherwise.

However, although I *love* many franchises, the Sonic franchise is the only that one I'm truly **passionate** about. However, when coming into this series in late 2008 (around Unleashed release) I quickly realized the dark truth surrounding this series history and it's fanbase.For 10 years, I have dealt with a fanbse littered with arguments &amp; disagreements, separate factions, disgusting personal interests (i.e fanart, fanfiction, games), rejection/ostracization towards the media, fans treated as a joke, hatred, toxicity, and an ever growing non-unification towards different ideas/viewpoints. I have never seen a franchise so divided and detached in my entire life, and with the recent arguments surrounding Sonic Forces and Mania, it's nearly broken my passion in everything regarding Sonic the Hedgehog, almost as if Sonic is now two political parties arguing towards which stance is correct. At this point, it makes me wonder: What would happpen if I never cared? If I never wanted things to to improve; To see this series under control. Would things be easier?Sorry for being dramatic, but I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say. I hate caring.",

Music with soul is where you can feel the heart of the artist in the dedication that they put into it and that can be expressed in a variety of ways. In bands like modest mouse even know Isaac Brock isn't a good singer the way he delivers his lines are filled with such emotion and passion I would call that soul. On the other end there's Stevie Wonder, somebody who can sing incredibly beautifully and deliver lyrics in such a way that you can hear the passion of what he's speaking about. But on the other albums with artists like Daft Punk  I can hear the soul based on the amount of craftsmanship and attention to detail that they put into their work. Especially on an album like RAM. Contrast this with Dr. Luke, a famous pop song producer in Hollywood currently, who makes, to me, some of the most soulless music I've ever heard. And I love pop music. But his work is so stripped of anything resembling a heart and soul it just feels like it was produced in a factory. I never could quite grasp why I thought that way until I read an article in the New Yorker about Dr. Luke. In it, somebody recalls when Dr. Luke was the guitarist for the Saturday Night Live house band and while out to dinner Dr. Luke mentions that playing jazz guitar isn't that hard all you got to do is hit the right cord and played over and over again, I'm paraphrasing, but yet even though people kind of shook their head at him when he said that he became one of the best guitarists jazz wise in NYC. This crystallizes my issue with Dr. Luke's work. His his music is to \"real\" music, I say that because I don't have another word to use that would fit well, what a Big Mac is to a home cooked meal. It is easily made, it is digestible for the masses, but it has no qualities beyond that. It goes in one ear and out the other. His music will be thrown in the dustbin of history the same way a majority of the Monkees discography is. His Music is what I define as having no soul. I'm interested to hear what you guys think about what I've written here and what you guys think about music with soul and music with no soul.",

Currently, the computers available for me to use are very old or are not available for prolonged or comfortable usage or are not easily portable. I've decided to buy a laptop to fill in these needs. Unfortunately, I've been mostly using fairly old hardware and am out of touch with the current processing power benchmarks on the market for laptops and can only name some characteristics that are required of it.As I've mentioned, in the near future it will mainly be used for programming and web developement, as well as documenting. Expected are: lots of typing, working with text, some Web server operation. I'm thinking of buying a separate keyboard, so the default one is not much of an issue. Not sure about the monitor, so screen size is a factor, but a monitor ports still are valued.I will be stuck with this laptop for some time. Processing power should be satisfactory in comparison to new models for at least next 2 years. Plus, in the future I also plan to use it for some other stuff, such as video and audio editing, 3d/2d animation which can hog the processing power. Also important is heat management, as well as damage protection, since I tend to drop or hit things by accident. I tend to be easily distracted, so noice level is also a factor.For the most time, the laptop will serve as a desktop replacement at home and WI-FI is not always optimal for Internet, so an Ethernet port is a requirement. I'm not planning to actually carry it around that often, so the form factor and weight can be considered an afterthought. Same goes for battery life, although I would like its power usage to be reasonable.**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**     * Country of purchase: Latvia     * Budget range: 700-850 EUR     * Purpose (netbook, ultraportable, mainstream, gaming, desktop replacement, etc.): desktop replacement      * Screen size preference: Greater than 14\"     * OS preference (Windows/ Mac/ Linux): Linux     * Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): None     * Performance requirements (video, CAD, etc.): Not sure, needs to be suited for programming, web developement, video, audio editing and stay comparable to newer models for the next couple of years.     * Method of computer support (office supplier, college bookstore, self support): self support will do.     * Brand preferences and reasons (already owned accessories, familiarity, business    compatibility): NOT HP (bad experience with running Linux on it).      * Any particular style that you like (examples are great): Gray or Black finish.     * Which of the following qualities would you prefer?

My old friend safari in X (set up on my old DS) is Steel type, and my new friend safari in Y (set up on my new DS) is Normal type.  When I put my Y cartridge in my old DS, and my X cartridge in my new DS, and start up Y, all the safaris from the friend codes I registered come up, along with the one I set up on my new DS, with the IGN I used in Y, Normal type, and the avatar I used in X...**  Obviously I've confused my systems by using both cartridges in both DSes lol... so does this mean that no matter which game I'm in, if I'm using my new DS it will always be Normal type, and the same way around for the old one and Steel type?",

I've been so overloaded with exams lately that although I've swallowed the pill, I've not really been able to apply it to the extent that I'd wish to.For more context: I am a first year university student in the United Kingdom.Anyway, I'd always looked up to some of my friends in how they score women, however I'm beginning to notice RP truths:- One of my friends, almost always 'pulls' (sleeps with) 3-4/10's when we go to nightclubs. He has strong oneitis for a HB3 who he once slept with, she is short and fat, and yet this guy won't shut up about her. She's made him into an orbiter, even when I am speaking to him about other things, he will find some way to bring her into the conversation and he'll go anywhere she wants (for example, when she's bored and wants him to entertain her, she'll call him around and he'll go to her). I've tried telling him why on earth would he go for a HB4, but he won't listen. I am confident that I can sleep with better looking women once my transformation is complete.- My other friend is interesting. He's a close friend of mine, he is objectively good looking, quite square-jawed. When he's single, he can sleep with HB7's and occasionally a HB9. He does seem to be very confident and hot-headed, and chicks dig that, but since we're good friends, we've disclosed a lot with each other and it turns out he is very prone to oneitis. The confident bad-boy persona he has when single instantly dies whenever he gets with his ex-girlfriend. He was crazy about his ex when he was with her a few months ago and he turned down many HB7's to be with his girlfriend (a HB8). However they broke up as she cheated on him and his bad boy persona soon after re-emerged, however he recently got back together with her and now she is bossing him around; it's terrible to see my good friend get controlled like this, it's like he's 80% natural Alpha but oneitis is a recurring disease for him. He grew up in a rough area and he's done well to get to university, you can tell he's a confident and tough guy, but damn, oneitis has completely overtaken himAnd now my other good friend, let's call him Mark: I never considered Mark alpha like the first two, but I'll comment on Mark anyway:- Mark is a nice guy. A good friend of mine too, and when I say nice, I mean it in the most genuine way. However he has no hope, he is so damn Blue-Pill. He told me that he wants to lose his virginity to a girl he trusts (LTR?), fair play, but he's not making any attempt whatsoever to approach. I suggested that he go to the gym (he's very thin) but he said he's not interested, again, fair play, but he doesn't seem to have anything going for him. He's not particularly ugly, but he doesn't have much going for him either. Whenever he does talk to a girl, he asks very boring blue-pill questions (e.g. ''Hi where are you from? Hi what do you study?'') and he can't escalate whatsoever, he also has a huge tendency to talk about himself, when he starts doing that, he never seems to know when to shut up. The only girl to have shown interest in him was a HB2 landwhale.^ Mark is a good guy, but hopeless. This next example cements RP truths, we hang out with a girl on our course, and she's a HB7 on her very best day (nice face, average body). When we were at the pub without Mark one day, the conversation somehow got to the topic of Mark and she said ''He's so adorable. I wish I could adopt him'' --- instantly confirmed the friendzone, she did not see any sexual relationship with him whatsoever. Zero.**The hardest part about swallowing the Red-Pill isn't seeing the world for what it is, it's seeing my friends deteriorate knowing that I can never tell them about The Red Pill. I don't like my friends being like this, but I have no choice but to hopelessly watch**.",

Now I know I'm not supposed to compare myself with others, it's not healthy, but these past few weeks I've been feeling more disconnected and like I'm not being a good Buddhist. Ridiculous as that sounds. Part of me wants to get rid of some of these darker emotions and to feel the serenity and calm that I see in so many teachers but I also realize that the only way to reach the state of calm is to except my darker, more unpleasant emotions and to realize that they only have the power that I give them. Once I let them rise and fall without giving in to the temptation to react *then* I'll be free. I've mainly been doing a lot of my meditation and research into the Dharma alone. I don't have a car and the nearest Buddhist temple as many miles away from me. So, I practice by myself and with the help of podcasts like Audio Dharma. That was also part of the reason I didn't feel like I was being a good Buddhist. Now I'm sure you're wondering what this has to do with that amazing post on sexual abuse. At first, when I read it, I felt sympathy and pain for the person who had been abused, then anger at the man who did it, and finally disappointment. But eventually, it helped remind me that I'm doing OK. I know I need to find a song got to go to eventually. But since that isn't in the cards for me as of right now I'm just gonna do my best and listen to the wise people on these podcasts. More importantly, it made me realize that people like us, like me, should give ourselves more credit. The people that live in the non-ordained world. The ones that work 9-to-5 jobs and still do our best at following the Dharma, we should pat ourselves on the back. Because the fuckboys like Sogyal Rinpoche or Trungpa, The ones that sit and pretend to have some sort of inner knowledge on peace and skillful development of character *are frauds*. It's easy to sit in a peaceful Zen Center, surrounded by devoted people who hang on your every word, and act enlightened, calm, and relaxed. But that don't mean shit. Let me see these guys work a customer service job at someplace like McDonald's, on six hours of sleep, then getting screamed at by some customer for getting their Big Mac wrong. If they can handle that and still maintain the same attitude as the one they got in the pretty little Zen Center, then we'll talk. It's easy to give out the prescription, it's harder to take it. That's my thoughts on it anyways. Thanks for anybody who finished reading through this rant.",

Eventually you found something that told you to go to the next village, and doing so added a day onto your time counter.It was a game where you moved one time at a time per push of the arrow buttons. It was in real time when you moved but it was turn based when you started fighting an enemy. There was a little written description along the bottom or side of the screen for the combat moves. The graphics were naturally crude (this was an early to mid nineties game) but they were sophisticated enough that, say, a pile of copper, gold, or platinum coins actually looked like a pile of coins. There were the standard \"magic arrow\" and \"energy bolt\" type attacks. Something that sticks out to me is if you fired like \"cold bolt\" there was a little animation of a circle spreading out from the enemy that covered like nine tiles.

Her fiancée says he's going to shoot it if it isn't dealt with, and we are obviously looking to do something. We got to interact with the kitten and it is super friendly. It's constantly coming up for pets and affection, and we have fallen in love. We want to take her back to Seattle with us, but there are some concerns that we have (trip home aside):* we would obviously get it checked by a vet and vaccinated and spayed before we leave* I'm not 100% sure if it's litter box trained. It looks to be between 4 and 7 months, so we know that's tractable, but we're prepared for the hard road ahead there* we have a one bed, one bath with den in Seattle. We also have a one year old cat already. This cat was the only one in its litter so it's super outgoing and lovable, same with the kitten. I'm prepared to keep the kitten in the den until she acclimates then get the kitten integrated with the cat. We have separate places for both food bowls and litter boxes.My big concern is with the sudden change. We will have been gone for two weeks (we have a good friend who our cat loves staying at our place and taking care of her) and suddenly we come home smelling all different with a new cat. I'm unsure how she will take it. I'm also concerned with how the kitten will adapt from being outside to being in a smaller apartment. Since my SO and I are both working a fair bit, it would be nice for our cat to have a friend to play with. I know she sometimes gets lonely. But I don't want our current cat to feel like we just dropped all this change on her and that we don't love her anymore. I think this kitten could make the change to indoor cat fairly easily but I'm a little scared for how much this would scare the kitten. Does anyone have experience with this? Any tips or suggestions? Should we take the cat back with us? Or should we put the cat in a shelter in bentonville and leave her behind?",

Now I think the way Dre used old P-Funk samples to create a unique genre completely fitted to the West Coast was visionary but, that's about it. But with the Straight Outta Compton movie all I keep hearing is how they were visionaries who changed the world with their words and music. Now most of this I can put down to the standard movie marketing shit, after all, how can you expect to sell tickets if you say the film is about a couple of average guys? But it got me thinking about their legacy and honestly I can't find anything deep about their music at all other than the beats. The lyrics range from misogynistic to simply gross I mean, take a look at this one:          \"So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!/ You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't no sucker!\"Or this one:\"Yo, I tied her to the bed/ I had to let my niggaz fuck her first/ Loaded up the 44, yo/ Then I straight smoked the ho/ 'Cause I'm a real nigga.\"This doesn't exactly sound like a group that was into deep thinking. Yet we have articles on Pitchfork praising them in this article as [\"the alternative to reality shows like COPS\"](http://pitchfork.com/features/from-the-pitchfork-review/9704-who-got-the-camera-nwas-embrace-of-reality-1988-1992/) but at the same time, these guys weren't trying to do that, at least I don't get that feeling, anymore than Odd Future was trying to make a big statement about society as a whole. It seems to me that they were a bunch of middle class kids fucking around with some incredibly dope beats that changed the world but rapping over them about childish, misogynistic violent fantasies. I don't mind that per say but I'd prefer if people were at least a little more honest about what the group was. Anyway, that's my take, what do you guys think?             ",

I'm not that old, but I remember a time when the male symbol was a little rectangular man, and the female symbol was in a big obvious triangular skirt. Easy.Then came a trend of just M and F. Not too bad, but confusing for those who don't speak English.Then the male and female \"symbols\"- the male with a circle and arrow pointing up, and the female with a circle and a cross below. Not bad, but also not a universally understood concept.Nowadays more egregious examples include:- Words in non-English languages, in countries where those languages aren't widely spoken. If I'm in Australia eating at a German restaurant, I don't want to have to pull out my phone to translate \"dammen\" and \"heeren\".- Stick figures with the most subtle differences. Some female symbols are the male version with just a tiny curve at the waist. Ridiculous.- One triangle for women and an inverted triangle for men. Fuck that shit. This is no time for hieroglyphics.- The most ridiculous version I saw was two blank doors with a statue in between. The statue  was of a man standing and woman sitting. The door closest the man was the male bathroom and vice versa. There was a lot of art on the walls and the statues just looked like another piece of artwork.Quit it, you morons.

Having escaped capture for quite sometime, he was caught by one of the death squads stealing land in Texas and was immediately sent to the capital to be made an example of by the technocratic witch. While some of our operatives were stationed in the capital, they did not have the means to save Henry Jefferson.After reaching the capital our information tells us he was guarded at all times in an inhumane cell and tortured for information. This would explain why some of our bases are being discovered. Based on the information he was forced to disclosed many of our forward bases are known. After being tortured for information he was sent to the guillotine that was erected outside the jail. This execution was made into a spectacle and many of the New Topekan citizens were gathered around to watch this innocent man die. Multiple of our operatives were also in the crowd to try and assassinate the dictator, but sadly with the bitch came her guards and all through the crowd were soldiers to keep the people oppressed and stop them from rising up. Henry Jefferson was lead into the guillotine in heavy shackles and his mouth was gagged to prevent him from spreading our message and inciting the crowd to turn on their queen. He was laid down onto the bench of the contraption and a basket was placed under his head. his shackles were hooked to another set on the machine to stop him from escaping. Before he was murdered the Blood Empress gave a speech justifying her soon to be murder and why we should stand down and not rise up against this oppression. After her guards and herself made it to the rope she yanked it and down went the blade killing our comrade Henry Jefferson. May he rest in peace. This is why we must not give up our mission we must not be scared of our death at the hands of a dictator. We must prepare to rise up and forcefully overthrow her and remove Technocracy form America once and for all!**Comrades Communism will prevail**---* Rust Cultists are also commies * Rusties hate Technaut Kathrine Lincoln* Don't worry no civil war or anything.

The people I work with come off as friendly, which makes me alright with being there for eight hours per day.One thing has helped though: not seeing it as an \"eight hour work day,\" but rather simplifying it into portions. So,* Work, break, work, lunch, work, break, work, end.As opposed to telling myself just \"work\" for eight hours with no variety. Remaining mindful of the breaks keeps me aware that I can choose to walk so as not to allow myself to stagnate or grow antsy.It's also made me aware how important environment is, in that I feel little to no temptation to doddle off online like I do when I'm at home, because I'm on the clock.

I just recently moved home to be around supportive people, and I've been struggling with how to incorporate old aspects of my life into the new. ANYWAY, I was super sad, and my cousin saw something I posted. So, after work she drove 2 hours to cheer me up. I was standing in my backyard with my dog, kind of wallowing in sadness, when I heard a car horn honk repeatedly. I was thinking \" man, I wish I had friends to do that for me, that driver sure is excited to get someones attention.\" My mom insisted I go look, and there she was! I think that's the first time I've ever had a wishful thinking actually happen. She came with so many gifts for my daughter, and we got ice cream! It was the happiest Ive been in a while. Unfortunately, I had a scare and we spent the next day at the hospital. Everything was okay, thank goodness, but our time had to be cut short because she had work today. But I swear, it's the little things. They can make all the difference to somebody who is struggling. I'm doing a little better. I'm not trapped inside my head anymore. I know it'll get bad again, but it's so nice to be happy for a little while!",

I respect them for what they accomplished, I like a few of their songs, especially the instrumentation on them, Tina Weymouth's bass playing is incredible, but I just can't get over David Byrne's voice, it's so grating. The only reason I've kept listening to the albums is because so many people swear by them and so many bands that I love, love them as well. In addition, The glowing reviews that were given to them really didn't hurt either. The magic of good critical reviews is an album that on first glance may seem really shitty to you, but since the reviews are so good somebody just thinks \"well I didn't *get* it\". I include myself in a category like that. For years, if a majority of the critics said it was good I would try to convince myself I thought it was good as well. Sometimes they would immediately click, others would grow, and some I would just not like. Case in point being the talking heads. On the flipside of that is modest mouse, one of my all-time favorite bands of all time. When I first heard Teeth Like Gods Shoeshine, I hated it, but reading the reviews I gave it another shot. And eventually the song, and the whole album, The Lonesome Crowded West clicked with me. It wasn't until I started listening to the needledrop that I realized you can hate a classic. Even more, you can dislike an album that everyone loves. The classic example I use for this is Kanye West. The first time I ever watched a needle drop review was for the album Yeezus. I expected another fawning review, what I got instead was a guy who proceeded to bash the shit out of that album. I was blown away because usually if Pitchfork gives it a good review that means everybody else is. But the idea that he didn't like it and gave valid reasons for it still makes me happy. I may not always agree with him but I respect his willingness to disagree with the common review narrative of an album. Because sometimes it just feels like critics give good reviews to shit and don't give a lot of good reasons and then a bunch of other critics follow their lead, and then the people follow their lead and say the album is good even if they themselves don't really get it. I recently made a post hear about Turn Blue, The Black Keys album. Critics gave it mixed to average reviews, and many people I know follow the same pattern and dismissed the album as wishy-washy psychedelica. Now I'm not saying those views are invalid, all music is subjective, but for my own personal experience I know that people are more likely to agree with the critic just because they're a critic. I have a feeling that if the critics gave rave reviews to Turn Blue and said it was a deep, thoughtful, well produced meditation on the lead singers break up, a lot of people would agree and say the same thing. Of course there would also be people that would say it was overproduced and they missed the grid your sound of the old Black Keys. But I feel like more people would have given it a chance. Now I'm not just speaking about the black keys because I'm butt hurt I was just using them as an example. Anyways, what do you guys think about how much influence and sway  critics have in our society and in our own minds?",

I do genuinely love her and enjoy hanging out with her.That being said (of course), this woman is going to drive me over a fucking cliff.DH and I are child-free. Everyone else in our lives seems to understand and accept this, except for his mother. DH and I have been together since we were kids, and neither one of us have ever ever ever expressed a deep desire to procreate. I didn't have any baby dolls as a child. DH has never even held a baby. This is not a sudden revelation.Despite all this, MIL began asking me about grandkids about two years into dating DH. When I was 16. She brought it up once or twice a year, and after the first time I explained to her, calmly and clearly, that her son and I were likely to NEVER have kids, I just flat-out ignored her comments.And then the wedding. THE DAY we got back home from the honeymoon, MIL mentioned babies. I remind her, \"hey MIL, we're not going to have kids\". MIL acts like this is the first she's ever hearing about this. The next month, we're in town visiting the parents. MIL was telling me a 'hilarious' story about how my mother recently texted her about finding a rare fruit that they both enjoy, and how my mother began the text exchange with \"MIL, guess what\" and how MIL's first guess was \"WONTON IS PREGNANT!\"I just looked at her and walked away this time. I had a talk with DH about it, and he told me that his mother has never even spoken to him about kids in his whole life. Clearly, she assumes that I make all the reproductive choices in our marriage and his opinion is irrelevant. I told him I'm not doing this for the rest of my life and he needs to talk to her. He does, she says she understands, everything is peachy.Cue two weekends ago (we're on month three of marriage, btw, so we're looking at one of these convos a month so far) and me and her are talking about fucking plastic surgery of all things, having a totally random conversation about how much easier getting lipo would be than working out (we were pre-wedding gym buddies, and it was a really fun time actually). Then she says \"well Wonton you can't have plastic surgery now, you'll just have to do it all over again after you have kids\"I swear to the Goddess and all that is holy.I just looked her in the eyes, touched her shoulder, and said \"MIL.... for the love of God.... I've told you this 1000 times. this is time 1001. I don't want children. Your son doesn't want children. We're never going to have children. If you want grandkids, you'll have to ask SIL.\"MIL looks at me and goes 'uh huh, sure'DIS MOTHERFUCKER DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE ME, what is there not to believe???? I will never understand.This time I told DH that if he doesn't sort his mother out, I'm going to deal with it my way, and no one is going to like the way that I deal with it. Because, as my friends and family all know, I am not a nice person. They love me anyway.And then the Universe decided to throw the perfect opportunity to do so my way. We got a pup this weekend (yay!!!!!), and MIL texted me after we made the announcement post on social media. I asked her if she liked her new granddaughter and she says \"that's just a dog, I want a real grandchild. Are you and DH coming to visit today?\"oh no you did NOT use the word 'just' about my dog, who just so happens to be, objectively and quantifiably, THE cutest dog to ever grace Gaia's bosom with her lil jelly toes.\"too bad that's the only grandchild I'm going to give you. We're not going to make it down today\"sweet silence.Edit*: [Puppy](http://i.imgur.com/GeoQkP7.jpg) [tax](http://i.imgur.com/ITJHxab.jpg)",

I didn't take any spontanous trips in my life yet, I'm more of a planner, but I gladly give up \"control\" because he's more experienced and I trust him with this. Now I have 2 questions:1. How do I \"keep my cool\" when something goes wrong/isn't perfect because of the spontanous nature of the trip? How not to fall into the \"we should've planned the whole thing more\" trap? I really want to avoid that, but I know that in my BP-years I would've said such things.2. We will be camping a lot, staying away from towns and hotels. It depends on the weather.

Most noticeable at low speeds backing up etc, but it can certainly be felt(to a lesser extent) at highway speeds. Obviously it's out of warranty, but has anyone else experienced this on the Soul(or other Kia's?) Anyone know what the problem is? Is it something major or dangerous? Should I use any particular verbage to convince the dealer it's a safety hazard and to extend a goodwill effort to fix?Update: Kia dealer found the problem. As it turns out it was exactly what I suspected after my Google research, the [little rubber \"isolator\"](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PhGs1D8hL._SY355_.jpg) that resides between the steering column and the power assist motor(I think it's under the dash?). Got charged $75 to locate the issue, and I was quoted 2.5 hours of labor at $242 total to fix(less the $75 if I let them fix it). Tech said it's only the 2nd Soul he's ever seen with a worn out isolator, so it seems relatively rare considering the Soul is Kia's best selling model. It is worth mentioning that this is NOT associated with the 2014-2016 Soul steering recall failure(s).",

With the recent discussion about DUST and bigger talk about challenges open only to the PC Gaming Master Race, I offer a challenge I call \"Laser Fried Speedrun Or: You Can't Spell Set Lasers For Fun without F U.\"Basically, it's a three-step process after starting a new game:1) Enter \"player.additem f82aa 1\" (this adds the Disintegrator, a unique Laser Rifle that does 999 damage per shot and was created during development as a testing tool, to the player's inventory.)2) Enter \"player.additem 4485 500\" (500 Microfusion cells.)3) Kill everything in sight and do quests whilst trying to reach level 50 as quickly as possible.  It's harder than it looks, because yes, you can mow through everything easy-peasy, but you need to keep moving to new areas constantly in order to find stuff to do because quest rewards are a lot faster than simply blasting everything that moves.Optional rules:A) No fast travel.  Tends to turn it into something that is less speedrun and more endurance-gaming event.B) Skip the second step above and rely on finding MFCs and converting found Energy Cells and Electron Charge Packs to get more ammo.  In the earlygame, this will force you to conserve your shots, but by the time you're out of Nipton, you should have more than you'll ever need.C) Try it in Hardcore Mode, where ammo has weight and Microfusion Cells are annoyingly bulky at 10 to the pound.  It's not THAT hard (especially since the Laser Rifle is truly the only weapon you need and will carry), but it becomes something else to consider when building your character.D) Show that goddamned Tunneler outside the safehouse in DUST what's what, the little bastard.For what it's worth, I'm an atrocious speedrunner and tend to use this ruleset for what I call One-Day Cricket playthroughs (exactly what it says on the tin; I'll wake up on Saturday morning around the same time I wake up for work during the week---6:30 or 7 AM---and play until 10 or 11 that night, timing it to finish at Hoover Dam), and it's excellent when suited to that purpose.  But a time trial's good too.",

I am doing this to save money, even though I know I will most likely have to take out some loans for my university.I also work two part time jobs. 7 hours at a tutoring center and around 15-20 hours at an electronics retail store. Since I live with my parents I do have a lot of expenses covered like food and shelter. However to help my parents out I pay for the families car insurance and also the family cellphone bill. In total it adds up to about $500. Now I make enough to barely cover that and leave me enough money for gas. I commute to school and its the only way for me since the university I plan on going to is about 45 minutes away from me but i only plan on going there twice a week. When I was working during the summer and holidays I was making enough to put about 20% of my paycheck towards my savings every check. However since retail season is done now i am not getting as many hours as i used too. Again i make enough just to cover my expenses and gas.My question is that how can I still save with limited funds. I would like to have an emergency fund ready in case something happens but with my current situation it doesnt look like I will be able to until I graduate or get a better job.",

		"text": "First and foremost: thank you to all the IDs who offer advice on this sub! Bit of background: I’ve been an elementary teacher 12 years (3rd-5th grade language). I have a BA in Art and Design, a Masters in Teaching, and a Reading/Writing specialist graduate certificate.  I won’t go into the lengthy list of reasons I feel I need to leave teaching, but safe to say I can’t do it anymore. Six months ago I started a barrage of personality tests, career placement tests, and skills inventories to find out what I should do instead. Administrative assistant and paralegal were consistent on all tests, but I have zero interest in those. Then one day I was looking at job boards and saw “Training Instructional Designer”.  That started me down the rabbit hole of researching and reading about all things ID. On paper it seems like a perfect fit for me. A good blend of creative and intellectual, teaching and design. I have six months left on my teaching contract so I’m now scrambling to figure out my next move and....I’m struck with paralysis. I’m overwhelmed with decisions on should I get more schooling, what type and where? I’ve spent hours looking up grad schools and certificate programs. I’m overwhelmed with the knowledge gaps I have in software. The list of programs to learn keeps growing. My Lynda playlist has enough courses in it to last the next few years. I feel like given the right guidance and time I could learn anything because I love to learn. I could learn ID on the job, but that’s not really how it works based on the job postings I’ve seen asking for many years of experience. But let’s say by some miracle I got hired tomorrow. I’m sitting in my new office and my boss says, “Hey, make this course!” I would have no clue what to do or where to even start. A recruiter I met with said not to take any grad classes, get hired without them. But I’m consumed with major imposter syndrome. At this point I might be able to bluff my way through a conversation about ID and appear intelligent, but in reality I have no idea what I’m doing.The more I dig into ID, the more overwhelmed and confused I become.

It can be a football game on tv, a movie, a video game or a task or chore. We get into arguments about this because my wife will try to talk to me and I won't respond. This has recently reached a fever pitch. We are arguing about this several times a week. I'm not actively ignoring her I just don't process the sound into any sort of intelligible meaning. It's as if I'm deaf. I've told her this and suggested she needs to physically break my attention. She can poke me, elbow me, clap loudly next to my ear, stand directly in front of me and whatever I'm doing, I've even suggested she buy a bell, whistle or squirt bottle (someone jokingly, but if it works it beats having an argument) to use when she needs to get my attention. I admit I have a problem, and I have supplied a solution. So what's the problem?          She says I need to learn to pay attention to her. She always internalizes it as me not caring about what she has to say. How can I explain it to her that there's noting actively going on here? It's not like I hear her but choose to ignore what she said. I just do not hear her. Or am I in the wrong here? Do I need to work on being less focused or more aware?  TL;DR: Wife thinks ignore her but I actually just can't hear her when I'm focused on something else. I've suggested she physically break my focus before she begins to speak but she won't because she wants me to care about what she says.   Edit: I think I might have ADHD. This answers a lot of questions. ",

I stuck with it and eventually began to pick it up. Then in 2014 I came down with pneumonia. I had to be hospitalized, and I spent a week there. When I got out the whole world seemed upside down. Long Story short, I had depression. In 2015 I tried to kill myself, and in 2016 I was fired. At first I wanted to use my unemployment to sustain me and my wife as I started a business in esports. I wanted to open a LAN center and eventually grow into player management and streaming. My wife convinced me that I had to have a job and get benefits. So I got a job as a package handler. I couldn't cut it. I lost my unemployment and my dream just seemed to slip away. For about a month and a half we struggled with next to no income. I did finally get another job as a Data Entry Operator. I hate the work and the environment. I am looking for something else but I don't know how to go about it.I have 5 Associates Degree; they are in: Computer Science, Business Administration, Pre Engineering, Math, and Accounting. I also run video game tournaments about once a month but taht doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I like event planning but I don't feel I am good at it. I am not a detailed person. I like writing fiction, but again not sure how good I am at it. I always wanted to be a game direction, crafting stories and the mechanics behind the game but I am not sure how realistic that is. Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.TL;DR Kind of feeling lost on where to go. I like writing and Computers.

Warmed up with a quarter mile at 4 mph. Then I managed a mile without stopping at 6 mph. Walked another quarter mile at 4 mph to catch my breath, then started another mile at 6 mph. Disaster struck at .85 into my second mile when my headphones died. But I pushed through, finished the second mile and cooled down with another 5 minute walk.Look, I know it's not much. But I've been back on cigarettes and I haven't had one since Sunday. I was shocked I could maintain pace for a mile, let alone pull another one out of my ass.After the gym, I went to the grocery store and got some good food. Chicken breasts, veggies, and ingredients for chili I make that is pretty damn great and good for you too. Anyway, I needed to put it down somewhere and I figured why not here. My goal is to first get back to running 3 miles at a 6mph pace and then bring my 5k time back to where it was. As I build that endurance, I'm going to get into some light lifting. I'm recovering from a hairline fracture in my wrist, so I can't lift yet, but I'll probably start Starting Strength at the very bottom.Thanks for a place to vent.

Things like coal, oil, and other resources like gold, silver, and things needed for modern life are limited as is. How could post scarcity be possible when in fact, it goes against the fact that not everyone can get what they want. Post scarcity(correct me if I'm wrong), seems to be more of a vague hope than an actual process. Not everyone can get what they want. So, according to my teacher, the best system is one that competes to find the best way to use those resources. Take that as you will. So, what even is \"Post Scarcity\".

		"text": "So this is a post I've been meaning to make for awhile. I was undecided as to whether I would make it a post about my favorite unknown band and other people's as well *or* my favorite unknown band specifically. I decided to focus on this band because I want more people to know about them *and* because I feel that it was a crime they didn't get more recognition. However, if this post doesn't get that much attention, and I doubt it will, I'll make a separate one just so I can hear about what other people's opinions are on their favorite forgotten bands. So without further ado, let me introduce you to: The American Secrets, a.k.a. The Victorious Secrets a.k.a. The Free Credit Score.Com band that got booted. The American secrets were a five piece band that hailed from Detroit Michigan. They originally were known as the Victorious Secrets. And with that name they applied to be the new Free Credit Score.com band, which is how I came across them. Now for those of you who don't know, Free Credit Score.Com was a business they basically said they would give you a free credit score but not really, the details are in important, what matters is they had a band that played catchy 30 seconds songs in each one of their commercials. The original \"band\" was actually a bunch of French guys that lip-synched to pre-recorded music from another person, or band.Now for some reason, probably to gain more attention for the brand, the company decided to ditch the original band and hold a contest for a new one.  So they aired a bunch of commercials with different bands singing their own 30 second  jingles. Which, as I stated above, is how I came across the Victorious Secrets. I guess and I freely admit this, I was in the right place in the right mindset for the band to click with me. I was just starting to get seriously into music and when I heard their jingle. I thought it was awesome. So I looked up the band, listened to some of the tracks on either Facebook or MySpace, and even voted for them to win the stupid contest. They ended up winning and  released two EP's: The Fight and The Flight. Both of which I urge you  guys to check out. Things seemed to be looking up for them, they even had an appearance on Lopez Tonight. Also is pointed toward an album, at least in my mind at the time. But then, they dropped off the face of the earth. I think they released one more song on their Facebook page and after that I haven't heard a peep from them since. Eventually I moved onto other music and bands, and the American Secrets became just another weird purchase in the back of my iTunes library.  But recently, upon seeing their cool cover art and vaguely familiar name in my library I decided to give them another listen. If not out of curiosity , then nostalgia. And I was blown away. They weren't just some weird band, that only sounded good to me as a pimple faced teenager, but a fully fleshed out band with a great sound and a *lot* of potential. So much so that I'll make this bold statement: The four songs that I'm about to list are more interesting and dynamic than almost any song in the Foo Fighters discography, at least, to me they are. Wait! I can already hear the downvotes coming and the angrily typed out responses in the distance. *Hear me out good people!*, I beg of you. I love Dave Grohl as much as the next guy, and maybe the next guy after him. I Think he is an incredibly talented showman and performer, with a great heart and a wonderful demeanor, in addition to being one of the greatest drummers in the 21st-century, *but* his output in Foo Fighters has always struck me as bland. I mean at least in *my band* you can actually hear the bass doing something moderately interesting. There's great subtle use of keyboards, the guitars sound nice and crunchy, with some cool pedal effects thrown in I believe, but without sounding derivative and bland. And the lead vocalist — I can't remember any of these guys names and this post is a spur of the moment thing before I lose motivation — is absolutely fan-fucking-tastic. He has a very unique, dexterous voice that can hit the high notes in an elegant, pretty, way while also being able to get a little gritty and nasty. And as much as Dave Grohl is a great performer, his vocal talents are, at least in my humble opinion, pretty limited. He can keep a tune. But, his voice ranges,  at least in every song I've heard, from low, rather bland sounding voice to, LOUD GROWL! Example: \"One of these days....something....something....EASY FOR YOU TO SAY!\"Which isn't a bad thing, it's not objectively bad I think. But it's not *my thing*. Now, if any of you even decided to read this far, I bet you're wondering what I'm going to list these for fucking songs I mentioned in the above paragraph. Well here they are:1. [Neon Train](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YkZYtnh3_PI) I'm on mobile right now with a low data plan so I'm not sure if this link is right.2. [Mr. Cloud](https://youtube.com/watch?v=GJUrxR5pvn4) 3. [Let's Not Stop](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Pnq-pgx4WH4)4. [Riding On A Falcon](https://youtube.com/watch?v=RXJHfFdOSaM)I know some of you may wonder why I decided to pick the Foo Fighters out of any other band. I decided to after I ended up listening to one of the Secrets songs and one of the Foo Fighters back to back. And it came to me, there's no reason why The American Secrets couldn't have made it to the same level that the Foo Fighters did. They both make easy to listen to 3 minute long tracks. The only differences that the Foo Fighters make Hard Rock music with a tinge of Pop to it and the Secrets made Pop music with a tinge of Rock to it. Though it's hard to say based on four songs that I listened to where a band would end up had they succeeded haha. *But*! I firmly believe that without the connections that Grohl made during his time with Nirvana he stood no better chance of being noticed then the Secrets. To put it another way, I believe that if the Foo Fighters and the American Secrets were both unknown bands starting out at the bottom, the American Secrets would have success before the Fighters. Now, assuming that anyone decided to read this far, I think you for hearing me out. I'm sure there will be plenty here that disagreeand think they're absolutely worth being forgotten about, and believe that the Foo Fighters made better sounding, more interesting music. Which is fair enough, we're all entitled to our opinions. But I beg you guys to look up these tracks on YouTube and give them a listen before you judge. At the very least, you can agree that they make music on better than present day Maroon 5. At the heart of this post though, is my attempt to write something about a great band that got lost in the sea of other music out there. If through some miracle somebody who was in the band, or someone who knows one of  the band members reads this, I just want to say that *I* heard your music. I loved it then, and I still love it now. I think you guys are/were amazing and your music meant something to me. Anyways, thank you for reading and I look forward to your replies! - [ ] ",

Basically there is a co worker I really want to ask out at my summer job (I'm only there every Tuesday for the next month then I go back to school across the country, so the whole don't ask out co workers thing to me doesn't apply).Would inviting her for a walk (there is a nice area near where we work) and some gelato be a nice place for a first date? It seems like it would be casual, brief (or long) enough and something we could do one day right after work. Or would it be better to do something more formal for a date?Finally as a follow up question, how do I make it clear its a date rather than just two people hanging out after work, or would it be better to not make that distinction? My thought was to first ask if she was seeing anyone (I'm pretty sure she isn't) and then ask her out for gelato after work, hopefully that makes it clear that I am somewhat interested in her in more than a friendly level.Sorry for the essay, I just wanted to explain my thought process as best I could.",

The downside of temp is that it usually doesn't pay well. Is there a database of these agencies? I'd be looking for agencies in Minneapolis. What about higher-end (higher-paying) temping databases?- Info about good (better?) recruiting agencies. These are the people that either find direct-to-hire or high-paying contract work. It's great to make friends with them, but sometimes it can be a lot of lip service and dead ends because they're competing against other recruiters and applicants to find you a job. The upside of recruiters is that they have good connections to hiring managers. Is there a Minneapolis database of them as well?I'm not sure what else I need help with. My resumé and cover letter seem to get me in the door for an interview (had three interviews for project coordinating roles in the last month). I guess maybe my interviewing could use some work.

I am just really confused. Is business calc easier because what i am really worried about is that i take business calc and it wont be able to transfer towards another school if i want to transfer.

I have no problem accepting that I'm neutral, or maybe cool-leaning neutral, but I'm fairly certain I'm not warm (soft autumn) because any lipstick with even the slightest hint of peach or brown looks awful on me. The only thing I'm extremely certain of is that I look awful in all bright colors. So that suggests I might be a soft summer, but I don't look good in lighter colors, and soft summer palettes seem to include a lot of pastels. Also, I think (I could be wrong) that I look great in super dark plum lipstick, and I thought soft people were supposed to look bad with high contrast stuff? (Also I'm not totally certain what low contrast really means: I thought I would be high contrast, what with my pale skin and dark hair.)Sorry I don't have a wrist picture at the moment, but I think my veins typically look blue/purple in outdoor light.

There is a finite number of ways to arrange matter and energy in a universe.2. There are different kinds of matter and different kinds of energy that exist, so some may be included more than others in these universes (if at all).3. There are points in the universe with less energy and matter than others; empty spaces, if you will, that can be at any scale. Large areas of less matter and energy and small areas with less matter and energy.4. Time. Time would also effect the position of matter and energy at certain points. So you could have universes with the same exact amount of energy and matter that start in the exact same position. However, at a given point, that matter and energy shifts position in any fashion. What this all means is that there is a universe out there where the only difference between ours and its is that one single atom, say, 3,132,872 years ago moved a centimeter further away than that exact same atom did in our universe.Every kind of universe could be like this. Some with drastic changes and others with minor changes, comparing them to our universe, of course. There's a universe out there where Barack Obama is Spider-Man. And another universe where the only difference between that and it is that a blade of grass 2000 years ago swayed a millimeter further than it did in the other. Every different outcome of that universe exists just as every different outcome of any given universe exists.This number is...enormous. This number would break calculators and make numbers like googolplex look like the planck distance. But it's finite, right? Or am I missing something?",

		"text": "After reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/7mtq40/sterilisation_procedure_and_the_risk_of_early/) earlier, I did some research on factors influencing age at menopause. Figured I might as well share here. Feel free to post any more research you find about this or share your thoughts! Also, I don't have any medical or science background and this is not medical advice.***Basically, the studies below show that **age at menopause is affected by the total number of ovulatory cycles in one's lifetime**. More ovulatory cycles correlates to earlier menopause, and fewer ovulatory cycles correlates to later menopause.* CF women have more ovulatory cycles in our lifetimes compared to women who had children, because we generally don't have pregnancies and especially not full-term ones.* The second major factor is long-term use of hormonal birth control, which is associated with *older* age at menopause because HBC suppresses ovulation, which means fewer ovulatory cycles.(The other main factors are cycle length and age at menarche (first period) but these aren't CF-specific)So *my guess* is that if you used HBC long-term, then you *wouldn't* be at increased risk of early menopause.But if you didn't use HBC long-term, or at all, then that can increase your risk of early menopause. For example, if you used non-hormonal forms of birth control instead or you did not use birth control at all (e.g. if abstinent or in a relationship with a woman), then you would have ovulated incessantly with no suppression, which means a greater number of ovulatory cycles, which correlates to earlier age at menopause.***With respect to [the linked post](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/7mtq40/sterilisation_procedure_and_the_risk_of_early/), having had a tubal sterilization procedure (tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy) will not *itself* impact the age at which you reach menopause. However, having been sterilized generally means two things:1. You will no longer be taking HBC, which means long-term non-use of HBC (except in some cases to control periods or for backup)2. You won't become pregnant (except in cases of sterilization failure)**Both of these factors are associated with a greater number of ovulatory cycles in one's lifetime and thus also associated with earlier menopause.****The effect is especially pronounced for those sterilized at a young age.** If you were sterilized at a young age and stopped using HBC then (or you never used HBC even before sterilization), you could have *2-3 decades* of not using HBC and not getting pregnant, which does correlate to an earlier age at menopause.***=&gt; [Lifestyle and dietary factors determine age at natural menopause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24672198) - published 2014&gt; The age at natural menopause (ANM) depends on various factors [...] **nulliparity**, vegetarian diet, smoking, high fat intake, cholesterol, and caffeine accelerates; while **others like parity, prior use of oral contraceptive pills**, and Japanese ethnicity delays the ANM.Nulliparity accelerates menopause while parity or use of oral contraceptives - but really this would apply to HBC in general because they all suppress ovulation - delay menopause.=&gt; [Factors associated with early menopause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10802394) - published 2000&gt; Lifetime number of ovulatory cycles (indicative of oocyte depletion) is also predictive of the age at natural menopause (ANP). This is consistent with the many studies that have reported early ANP among women with shorter menstrual cycles, and a **later ANP among multigravid women or those who used oral contraceptives.**More ovulatory cycles in your lifetime is predictive of earlier menopause, and this is consistent with other research that has found *later* menopause among women who have been pregnant multiple times (multigravid) or used HBC.=&gt; [Does \"incessant\" ovulation increase risk for early menopause?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7856687) - published 1995&gt; [Women who experienced early menopause] had a greater number of presumed ovulatory cycles, as estimated from age at menarche, average cycle length, and **years of anovulation associated with pregnancies or oral contraceptive use**&gt; ovulatory cycles were a significant predictor of early menopause",

I am currently staying with family who was adamant that I take the first job I was offered. That job just happened to be working at a youth center with kids with behavior and discipline problems, such as anger, defiance, etc. I just learned \"intermittent explosive disorder\" is a thing. #TIL  Obviously, being as it is a tough stressful job with barely above minimum wage pay, they have a high turnover rate, so I got offered a job quickly. (Mental healthcare residential for an essentially juvenile justice type population). I work long hours, and have few hours off, I am currently looking for a new job though, but it's been tough because of my limited time off and being extremely tired and having to do errands/chores on off days.I am normally a pretty calm, easygoing person. These aren't your normal kids though. Being that I already don't like (the behaviors of) most kids, this has been pretty tough for me. Staff to kid ratio is 1:8 and groups are rarely double staffed. Kids are constantly breaking stuff, fighting with each other, and cussing out staff, being disrespectful. Due to my lack of interest in children/parenting I have a tough time handling my group. I'm really not used to dealing with kids, esp. such a rough population. I'm really reaching my breaking point. As far as the job and management goes, I feel like the training really didn't prepare me for how to manage the kids. I feel like a lot of times the kids run things. I usually just shrug it off and don't take things personally if a kid says something. Lately though I've been single staffed with no backup and having a hard time getting my groups to listen/follow directives. We are supposed to redirect them for cussing, verbal aggression, not following requests, etc. Of course they hate this and it pisses them off more and makes them act out. (Well considering a bunch of them are there for anger management and fighting type stuff, everything pisses them off). I feel like they don't listen to the regular staff, only the senior staff. But the senior staff says if we call them over that takes our \"power\" away. But there is barely anything we can do to discipline the kids. They say we have to remember these are not normal kids, and it's not a summer camp. Yet they expect the kids to do activities and outside play like it is, with rarely any \"sitting out\" or \"discipline\" for the kids who misbehave, cuss staff out, etc. I feel like they only like and listen to the staff who are buddy buddy with them and let them get away with stuff. Though I guess they don't really listen to those staff, because those staff let them do what they want. Of course, it's harder for the staff that actually holds them accountable for stuff. There are barely any consequences for the kid's actions. Kids are very verbally abusive to staff. Before I started working, kids stole knives and planned to jump a staff. Being kicked/hit, bit, or peed on are all hazards of the job, though thankfully none has happened to me yet.Having lost my former housing situation through no fault of my own, and having to move again has already been a tough adjustment. Feeling stressed, frazzled and fed up. The family I am staying with insist I not quit until I have a replacement job. But I already work about 11 hours a day including commute most days. It's just my dumb luck that the first job I got happened to be this one. (I was casting a wide net of applications). I know a lot of my fellow staff has the same concerns, which is why the turnover rate is high.So thanks for the ones who read this. Sorry for the wall of text. If I never wanted children before I certainly don't want them now. Just looking for advice and support. Thanks.",

The meat came out great and there was a little bit of flavor but not as much as I hoped.  Of course I can add more BBQ sauce and other seasonings to it, so it's not a total loss but I was wondering if you had any tips.",

		"text": "   What an absolute fucking masterpiece. Can you imagine if this had been released? This may anger some Beatles fans and others might disagree but I believe this album is *more* than an equal to Sgt. Pepper. Both albums suffer from small but minor flaws. Sgt. Pepper lacks the cohesiveness of an album and feels more like a collection of songs, magestic songs, but songs none the less. The Smile Sessions suffer a bit too much, particularly near the end of the album with songs that are far *too* short and don't contribute to the album at all. But from the album opener to Surfs Up we get something the Beatles never gave us. A story, a story of America, a story of love and loss and mystery and life. The run of songs from Our Prayer to Surfs Up feels like, in my mind whole movement. Or as Brian Wilson said \"A teenage sypmhony to God.\".      The whole God part is sold so well on the opener Our Prayer, I'm by no means a religous man nor do I like to think of myself as one prone to hyperbole, but this song guys.....I mean, shit. Our Prayer sounds like Heaven. These absolutely gorgeous harmonies just cascade through your speakers, into your ears, and submerge your mind into Brian Wilson's world, like a baptism of sorts. I could listen to harmonies like that for hours, they're *that* good. I started crying when I heard them because they're so goddamn beautiful, they are what I imagine would play when somebody walks through the Pearly Gates. I can picture little Cherubs with Harps singing this song. I don't want to overdue it on this song but I can't get over how amazing it is. There's no instruments on this three minute piece, just vocals, no words either. And yet, this song tells a story to me. It speaks to life and death, love and loss, winter and spring. It tells a story without speaking a word. *And* this is just the motherfucking intro.    After that we get Gee, a 47 second song that allows these brief snippets of the world that Brian Wilson is trying to create without the rest of the album suffering. Heroes and Villains is next and, what can I say about this song that hasn't already been said? It's epic. Part of the reason I say this album is the equal of Sgt.Pepper is because the Beatles never had a writer like Van Dyke Parks with them. Heroes and Villains gives me reminders of Bob Dylan during his more abstract phase, but with the ability harmonize like an angel. Following that is Do You Like Worms which to me, sounds like Danny Elfman composing the Beach Boys. I love it. The song keeps swinging between this tight sense claustrophobia and relief. It's almost like for periods of the song, the walls are closing in on the listener only to have them be pulled back at the last moment. It's truly remarkable how the scale of these songs seem so incredibly huge while also staying within in the 3 to 4 minute mark mostly.        After that we have just an absolutley gorgeous run of songs from I'm In Great Shape to Surfs Up, which to me feel like one whole song. It's crazy and the climax of the whole album to me has to be Surfs Up. Surfs Up is the reason this album has to be listened to as an album, not just as a collection of songs. Because Our Prayer, Heroes, and Villains, and Child is The Father of Man set the standard and tantalize us with the feat of magic that is Surfs Up. Wilson's vocals on that song are chilling, it defies the conventional verse-chorus-verse structure that the Beach Boys were so known for in their early days that it's hard to even imagine it's the same band. And the very ending of that song is truly amazing to me. The way all the different voices and singers  come together in such a dense way, while also giving enough room for all the harmonies to stick out blows my fucking mind. The ending of Surfs Up made me cry too. I've never had two songs from the same album make me feel that way before, ever.       Following it that we get the more ambitious and *really* weird songs of the album which I find to be a bit offputting, yet since this is a trip inside Brian Wilson's mind I find it to make sense in the context of the album. It isn't until the Mrs. O'Leary's Cow that I find the album really pulling me back in. O'Leary's Cow sounds just like the title of the song, elemental. It feels primal and raw and just dark. And the last two songs, Love To Say Dada and Good Vibrations complete this tour de force of an album. Good Vibrations gets a second spark of life here in the context of the album that breathes life into a song that, to me, has been far too overplayed. Anyways this album is a solid 10/10 to me. What do you guys think? I'm sorry for the wall of text haha.",

Never mind the fact that he improved himself. It's a very deterministic view, it's almost as if Blue-Pillers harbour disgust towards people who can change from failures with women to successes. In RedPill terms, natural alpha's are praised whereas Red-Pilled ones are look down upon with disgust.",

		"text": "Deck: https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/get-experienced/I've shared this deck before as it is one of my top 3 pride and joys. The deck is 5 color, general has been changed to Ramos, and the theme is running all 5 Experience Counter generals. Meren and Ezuri pull the most weight, a few cards to help with Mizzix and Kalemne, and while the deck *could* work off Daxos I don't think I've ever seen it happen. There's also a general subtheme of Reanimation and Legendary Creatures.The deck feels as straightforward as ever. Birthing Pod has been a neat addition as I can get back things I sac with Meren, and with Mycoloth and Avenger of Zendikar adding combo possibilities, or just good ol Kalonian Hydra- which might be overkill or game-warping on its own.Where the deck is now, it can have explosive turns, but is lacking in ways to come back from a wrath or series of counterspells. I want to devote a few card slots to rebuilding, and have come up with 4 strong potential add-ons and a handful of ones I don't think will make the first cut. As-always, cuts are impossible. As soon as I find a card to cut (like Sun Titan) I find 17 reasons why I shouldn't, and it usually involves combo potential. My top 4 additions are:+ Lurking Predators - Could rebuild in one round, hard to get rid of, and with one opponent playing storm there's a lot of potential for explosive comebacks. + Garruk, Caller of Beasts - I want this for reusable Lead the Stampede, where his -3 and ultimate would be considered gravy. 6 mana is a lot and he's more removable than Lurking Predators, but he has the ability to put more than 1 card in my hand at a time.+ Mystic Confluence - I originally thought this was the 2nd coming of Cryptic Command. I was incorrect, and have stopped using it a bit, but I see potential here- at worst it's a Jace's Ingenuity- it can rebuild my hand. Potential for counterspells and removal make this card extreme utility, and something I can hold onto until I have an actual need for one of its abilities. + Marchesa, the Black Rose - A recent cut, I realized her ability saves me from wraths, which is awesome. She can be a powerhouse on her own. She does require other cards to be good though, and requires me to not be winning. Her 4 mana cost also fights in pacing with the key cards Meren and Ezuri.Considerations:+ Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur - Most likely a 1-time grip refill. He's powerful, but too threatening and too expensive for a 1 time use. Though forcing my opponents to discard helps me a ton. If my reanimate was a little stronger I'd feel better about it but I think he's prohibitively expensive. + Fact or Fiction - a favorite of mine and a good way to get what you want to-hand and fill the graveyard. I'm looking for a little more of a guarantee refill than only 2-3 cards, and the deck isn't reactive enough to slot it in- I would find myself holding back mana to cast it.+ Kiora, Master of the Depths - she's a more reusable FoF...except not quite. I don't always get value off her -2, and I don't always get value off her +1. She's half as good as I think she is.+ Prime Speaker Zeganna - Refills my grip and creature-based. Also green for cards that benefit. She needs creatures on-board to be good so she feels win-more. The mana is a little intensive. + Sphinx of Uthuun - A bit expensive and like FoF doesn't do *quite* enough.My meta is starting to pick up pace and we're seeing a lot more combo and more removal. I'm open for any recommendations or advice on this deck, but cuts is where my focus is for sure as I already struggle :)Thank you and enjoy!Edit: Damia could potentially be another way to refill but relies on her surviving ",

I'd like to think that if I meet someone who happens to be of the opposite sex, develop a nice rapport/chemistry over then, then a romantic attraction would seem natural and frankly earned. Even better if that attraction is mutual, right? With friendship you can build up trust, familiarity, shared interests, basically everything that you would've done during a relationship's \"honeymoon phase\" except without the added pressure to impress each other. However.... I also don't want to be viewed as emotionally manipulative for basically pretending to be someone's friend so I can get in their pants when they're at their most vulnerable (ie bad breakup, etc). I also don't want it to seem like they're only pity dating me just to make me happy if they don't feel the same way I do. So basically, I'm currently having a mental tug-of-war over which is more important: the risk of losing your long-standing friendship and the reward of a romantic relationship if your feelings are reciprocated.Thoughts?",

		"text": "By age 20, I had a friend who inherited a rent free 2 story house that everything was paid for because of his aunt and some kind of backstory. All of my friends, except me because I didn't get the offer, moved in and lived everyday like it was a friday after high school. They all deepened their bonds and ignored me. One of my friends wanted to be a business man and inherited his father's store after he chose to retire and my best friend went military and already had a house before I was done with my second year of college. My bestie and I always had a brother type of friendship so we always were at the same level. One day, a girl from his past shows up and they bang. Shortly after, he gets a girlfriend. He then tells me, everyday, how he is constantly advancing and getting new opportunities while I sat at home unable to get a call back from mcdicks. It started out as him being excited about these new things but then developed into him bragging about it over the absolute nothing I had achieved. One day, I just sent him a text ending our friendship. Slowly, I started cutting ties with all of my other friends. I felt like I had lost nothing since the pictures on their social media pages were all of them enjoying good times and making memories without me. Their reason for never inviting me over? \"You never want to hang out, you always want to stay home so that's why we never ask\". That's because I take my studies seriously, you conveniently always call at the wrong times, and I don't text first because I don't want to seem like I'm bothering anyone. I was also plagued with stomach issues so I never ate on those days but it has been long corrected with medication. It's been about 2-3 years since doing all of this and they hardly ever cross my mind. I don't cry about it, I don't miss it, I just remember the few good times I had and tell myself to never go back. Without seeing how great their lives are without me, I have no one to impress or surpass so I'm taking my time and figuring out life a lot better. The best I've got going for me is a research assistant gig and hopefully a paid internship or retail job next spring semester (fall schedule has me getting out at 7-10pm everyday). And no, I don't have depression.",

Between the two kids and myself, we have appointments almost daily. Both kids receive speech and OT. My son goes to a special ed pre-k program three days a week. He also receives ABA therapy. I go to the chiropractor once a week, and am now up to weekly OB appointments. I also attend behavioral health every other week. I left the active duty (army) and we moved to a completely different state for my husband’s work, ie we have absolutely no help. My family lives 12 hours away. His lives 10. No local friends. He works 40 minutes away, for a 7:30-5:30 shift. I can count on one hand the amount of times he’s ACTUALLY gotten off at 5:30. And the hourly amount he gets paid isn’t remotely worth it to me. I’d honestly rather just have him home. He leaves before the kids get up and bedtime is at 8:30. On a good day he maybe sees them for two hours. I’m exhausted. Like.....even after sleeping 8-9 hours a night, I’m ready for a nap after an hour of being awake. I clean and sweep and vacuum and do laundry and dishes and groceries and dinner every night (I even meal plan) and finances and everything else that comes with the house. I take the kids to ALL their appointments. I manage to get to my own and more often than not, have to drag them along with. I go to bed every night dreading having to wake up the next morning. Every day is spent counting down the hours and minutes until he gets home. I break down in tears every time I get a text saying “hey I’m going to be late tonight”. If I dropped dead right at this moment, my husband would be lost. Even with a calendar on the fridge, he knows nothing. He doesn’t know the kids’ doctors or therapists or teachers. He doesn’t know who comes to the house or whose appointments we have to leave for, or where they’re even located. We have a joint bank account, with our budget on the fridge, and he still has no comprehension of our financial state. He doesn’t know our passwords or account numbers. He doesn’t know what bills we have on autopay or which we have to pay ourselves. He appreciates everything I do. I know he does. And he knows he’d be screwed without me. But I feel like I’m drowning",

They made me feel super uncomfortable and they were honestly kinda weird. It wasn’t all that long ago that I would look upon special needs kids with pity. And would feel even worse for their parents and caretakers. “Ugh I couldn’t imagine living like that,” I would think to myself. Then seven months ago, my three year old was diagnosed with autism, and my view on all that changed. My husband and I joined a local special needs support group. I learned very quickly that my views were all wrong. Those parents I used to pity are actually some of the strongest people I’ve ever met. Their children are incredibly sweet. I’ve learned to celebrate milestones, not wallow in the disability. Eating without a feeding tube. Breathing without a trach. Being able to walk without leg braces. A nonverbal counting to ten. Finally being potty trained. I’ve gotten the looks. I’ve been judged for my parenting methods. I’ve been told that if I just do things differently, my kid will “get better”. I’ve gotten the talk from members of my own family and it’s made me realize that you can’t make people understand.Those kids I used to avoid as a child weren’t weird. They were just different. And they weren’t any less of a person than I. If someone had just explained that to me back then, I think I would’ve been a far better person for it. ",

I live with my parents and my 2 siblings. Bird was never very social until my brother moved back in a little over 2 years ago. She didn't mind us reaching into the cage and would occasionally come and sit on your shoulder. When my brother moved home and he was looking for a job (all of us work full time so there's usually not anyone home during the day) he spent a lot of time with Bird and they became best buds. The moment she heard his voice she would fly right to him and cuddle into his beard; it was adorable. With all of these birds that we've had I've gotten to recognize their different personalities and see them all as individuals but since I haven't dealt with a baby in a really long time, I'm not really sure how to proceed.My brother missed Bird so he went out and bought another one. He watched the cage and picked out the most playful one. We've had Pepe for a little over 2 months and he's terrified of us. Granted we're not around during the day, but we try and spend as much time with him as possible, like sitting next to the cage after we left him alone for a few days. After a week he was ok with us sticking our hand in the cage and not touching him. After a while he would look scared, but allow us to touch his belly. He's never bitten anyone and his wings are still growing out so he can't fly.But he's seems to have gotten more afraid. We don't leave the cage open during the day because if he jumps down who knows how long it will be until someone comes home and helps him back into the cage. When someone is home we'll leave the cage open so he can explore a little.My sister thinks that she's the reason why he's so afraid of us. She was going to pick him up off the floor and he was running away. When she picked him up he got stuck in her hair and freaked out. We don't chance him on the floor anymore, we put the cage on the ground when we're home, but he hasn't made any progress in weeks and I'm afraid that he'll never be comfortable. He's very vocal and we talk to him when we're home, but he hides in the cornor when we're near him. ",

Kindly give inputs regarding- * Platform to form group * Number of members that should be allowed (I'm thinking around 15, so it's easy to interact and keep track) * Anything else you might find pertinent here.Edit: Guys, drop your WhatsApp numbers along with your names in my inbox. I'll make a WhatsApp group. ",

So we're watching the movie, holding hands, etc. and then she just suddenly gets all cold. Like it was a 180 from interested to not. Then we go back to her place and while I start expecting sex, we just change and watch netflix. Then we're laying together naked to go to sleep and she doesn't even want to cuddle despite saying she loves it and cuddling with me when I slept with her last. Then I acted like a bitch and asked if she was okay and if I did something, which she denied. She said she just wasn't feeling well and basically made me leave after making plans for me to sleepover. She kinda just acted really crabby all night after a certain point which doesn't make much sense given that she acted affectionate on the first date and an hour into this one.What happened to make her go from hot to cold in like an hour? Just during the middle of the movie after playing with my hands and holding them. Anyone have experience with this? I just like this girl and wouldn't be surprised if I never see her again after how she acted to me tonight out of the blue. Edit: Just remembered we drank last time but that whole change of attitude still makes no sense. ",

With this shows deep connection to classic literature, I believe that Ethan Chandler is modeled after Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

I'm planning on making a longer post devoted to them in/r/letstalkmusic so I'll leave some of it for there but I will give a background to them and my feelings on the band.Simply put, this is one of the greatest records of all time and the greatest \"lesser-known\" album out there. I ain't  talking about some Pinkerton or American Football shit (though they're both fantastic albums) I'm talking about some of the best songwriting ever laid down on vinyl, period.I know there will be people who'll vehemently disagree with me on this, and  probably have some good points to back it up, but it's just the way I feel.The Millennium were a musical group from the late 1960s, LA, sunshine pop scene. They were the supergroup that never was. They, like the Beatles, were the sum of the lesser parts, but in terms of control and overall vision they were almost identical to The Beach Boys . They were comprised of extremely talented singer-songwriters from around LA. with experience in pop, country, folk, and psychedelic. But the overall orchestrator and creative force in the band was Curt Boettcher. He was the Brian Wilson of the Millennium. With his vision and talent and the rest of the bands with the songwriting and overall skill they crafted some great bass lines and *even* better basslines. I hope you'll give them a listen. Assuming that you even made it through my wall of text thank you for reading haha.

I'm a Sag with Aquarius moon and I've always felt very strongly that is accurate. As I was going through I noticed that nothing else was really lining up.My sun in the 10th house says that I may have trouble with authority and that my father will influence me (which is true) but that I will rebel against him (which is not true). The reason why this fundamentally doesn't sit well with me is because I never desired to rebel against my father because I had respect for his authority from the beginning. A big part of who I am is my respect for others and their authority and I have prided myself in that.Mars in the 10th was only partially me. I do currently work in communication, but it once again brought up the trouble respecting authority figures. I work well in groups and prefer to be the middle man between higher ups and lower people. It may seem petty that I'm bringing this up, but respect for everyone, especially authority figures is a massive part of who I am.Pluto in the 9th house started off dead on, but turned as I read. It was corrects about me wanting to learn about extraordinary things, and my profound understanding of human nature (I'm extremely empathetic) but it says that once I make up my mind that I tend to be unchangeable. That's very inaccurate. I actually listen to people when they debate and have changed my mind on issues many times. Again, that difference is so profound, that the fact that the other part of the reading was accurate doesn't really mean as much. My Jupiter in the 7th house is very accurate, but it seems to directly conflict with Pluto in the 9th and Mars in the 10th. It's all about working with people and learning from them. Wanting to be close with people and collaboration. As I was writing this it's felt more and more ridiculous. For the most part, my chart was scary accurate, but I can't help but nit-pick some of these things just because I've worked hard to become very self aware. I guess what I want most out of this post is a discussion on whether other people have experienced the same thing. Did you find that you changed and something on your chart that you thought wasn't \"you\" ended up being something you grew into? Or the other way around, did you \"grow out of\" and astrological traits? I guess I'm also wondering generally, how much of your chat do you believe it nature and how much is it you making yourself into the person you want to be? Is there a balance?",

It took longer than I care to admit for me to realize that I'm not a genius, and there are still people in my life who want me to believe that I am one. In high school and college, my grades took a dip, and I thought to myself-- that's ok, you're still smart, you just have a poor work ethic. But it's become more clear that beyond a poor work ethic, I have a poor attention span, I'm a slow learner, and I have a low threshold for getting confused. I was addicted to a video game in the past, and I continue to be addicted to YouTube and Reddit, and I'm really afraid now that my brain has turned to mush and it's too late to set my neural pathways on a productive course of development.I can't remember the last book I actually read, even for a class. Listening to people who remotely know what they're talking about on subjects like science or philosophy, or even the paperwork associated with transferring colleges, is extremely disheartening to me. The worst is when they talk about politics, because I am majoring in Political Science but I barely even follow the news. I can't do research to form opinions or save my life, so whenever I am asked what my opinion is on any given issue, I just say \"I don't claim to fully understand the issue/ Both sides have a valid point/ Just leave it to the states and we'll see how it turns out.\" I'm a pseudo-centrist hack who voted for Gary Johnson because it would be the least offensive to everyone I know.I'm in a bad situation and I need to know if it is possible for me to ever be taken seriously.",

If I have my heart set on believing there's something after death, but then die and there's nothing... well, I won't be sentient anymore, so no hard feelings.One thing that I forgot to mention, I personally believe there's something because several relatives who died from various ailments, saw deceased relatives as they died. They all took some comfort from seeing them (going from barely responding to stimuli, to vivaciously conversing with long dead loved ones), and living family members took comfort in seeing that they weren't alone as they died.I'm sure that there's a scientific explanation regarding the brain, or memories but for now it's what I believe.Anyway, thanks all for commiserating with me, and thanks to those who tried to cheer me.",

There are many men who want commitment and many women who want casual sex, and the dynamic I have described applies across the board. I guarantee that the number of men who die alone, not through their own choice, greatly exceeds the number of women in the same situation, and it is known that isolation is a contributor to decreased life spans.So I say to you: Is this not unjust? Is there not something we can do to mitigate this deep-rooted societal inequality? Well there is.Even if you say, \"that's just human nature,\" when has that ever stopped us from trying to overcome human nature by educating people, engaging in activism, and spreading public consciousness to change attitudes for the better?That is what feminism has tried to do for the last several decades, and it has gotten massive public support. So why can't a little movement for men?",

		"text": "My favorite all time lyricist is Isaac Brock. I don't think he's the best, that title will always belong to Dylan, I just consider him my favorite. He's the first person to truly open my mind to what music can do. He was the first person to write songs with themes that connected to my life; being poor, depression, living in a trailer, disgust with the world. But the lyrics weren't just meaninful to me, they were beautiful. And as I grew older, I've been more amazed by his lyrics, considering the fact he never went to college he's written some of the most heartbreaking, insightful and unique songs I've ever heard. Contrast that to Bob Dylan who's also done the same for me, but has also studied some of the great poets of our time for inspiration. Now I can't say for sure but I don't think Isaac Brock ever did that. His lyrics, at least to my ear, have the sound of a person trying to figure out what they're feeling and can only do that by translating it into music. And in the process of that translation, he comes up with these insane metaphors and imagery. Dylan is of course the \"mountaintop\" to lyricists the same way Jimmy Page is to guitarists. He's written in every way imaginable. He's been the narrator to stories, the story itself, or he's just written stream of consciousness poetry. Then there's Van Morrison, who's peak was arguably Astral Weeks. Where he carved for himself a unique poetic space similar to Dylan's but at the same time fitted to his incredible voice. Sadly his lyrical quality decreased over time as the years went by. Anyway, if I had to organize these three I'd put Brock as the self made, confessional rough type. Dylan as the master of any style. And Morrison as somewhere in the middle between those two, depending on the album. So, what do you guys think? What artists lyrical styles do you enjoy? Why? What makes them unique? Feel free to include any rappers as well. I used the three men above as examples because I've been listening to them the most this month.",

The only thing that works for me in terms of staying on at least a \"nothing coffee and a 15-hour sleep on Friday night can't fix\" sleep cycle is having something to just slightly distract my mind when I start to get tired.  So I'll set YouTube to play one of Jon's long Fallout playlists, set the video quality to 144p to save bandwidth, and use it as a radio.Jon's voice has such a natural cadence and rhythm to it that it punts me nicely into sleep mode at no later than, say, one or two in the morning when I get up at 7.  Not great, but a can of Monster or a cup of coffee suffices to keep me functional.Without Jon's ability to alleviate my insomnia (that sounds kind of like a backhanded compliment, doesn't it?), I'd be chronically out of work and possibly homeless.So thank you, Jon.  Until I can get my freelance writing to pay for itself in terms of rent and food, you're keeping me alive.",

How differently would the remainder of the *Enterprise's* mission play out?**Short Term Changes*** Due to the contention between Riker and Jellico, Data's promotion to First Officer would likely remain permanent.* It's equally likely that Riker would soon be transferred off of the *Enterprise*, either by his own hand or Jellico's firmly pushing him out of the airlock.  Whether he moves on to his own command, remains a Commander, or even gets demoted is anyone's guess.* Given the changes Jellico immediately makes to the ship's crew operation (replacing bridge Science consoles with Damage Control and Weapons Status, moving to a four-shift rotation, instituting battle drills), we can extrapolate that the *Enterprise-D's* tacit mission of diplomacy and exploration would subtly turn to one of a more military bent, more aggressively pursuing Federation interests with hostile diplomats and along disputed borders.**Per-Episode Changes*** *Ship in a Bottle*: After a brief re-encounter with the sentient Professor Moriarty in the holodeck, Lt. Barclay is ordered to suspend and delete the Moriarty program in its entirety before it has a chance to endanger the ship.* *Lessons*: The new head of stellar cartography, Lt. Cmdr Nella Daren is reprimanded for recklessly diverting key ship resources, and is shortly thereafter killed-in-action on Bersallis III.* *The Pegasus*: Under orders from Adm. Pressman, the classified phased cloaking device is successfully retrieved from the *USS Pegasus* and used to escape from the Romulan warbird *Terix*.  The device is taken back to Deep Space 5 for further development and deployment on \"key Federation vessels patrolling the Netural Zone\".* *Masks*: After Data is hacked by an ancient alien probe and begins to take over the systems of the Enterprise with an inscrutable virus, Captain Jellico is reluctantly forced to deactivate him indefinitely.  The *Enterprise* is bought to a full stop and is later towed to Starbase 74 for a full computer refit.* *All Good Things...*: Without the foil of Picard to play against, Q's interest in the potential of humanity quickly fades.

		"text": "I've seen lots of comments and questions from people on Reddit and elsewhere wondering why Hawks fans are the way they are. Loud. Aggressive. Slightly insane. Been asked these questions myself. To those wondering, the five points below are for you. 1. **We knew long ago what y’all are just starting to realize about Russell Wilson (and the rest of the team).** You weren't impressed with Wilson because all you ever saw was a box score or fantasy football chart. Well, those of us who watched him from the beginning while y’all  were busy throbbing for Luck and RG3 and Kaepernick, we knew right away Wilson was special. We told you, and you scoffed. You dismissed him as a “game manager.” That we knew we were right – and that you’re now begrudgingly admitting the same – has only deepened our love for Wilson and the rest of these unknown superstars. 2. **And another thing.** It’s not just that our QB visits sick kids every Tuesday, or that our reserve RB overcame being deaf to become a pro, or that our lockdown CB is a high school salutatorian and Stanford grad. It’s not just that Peyton Manning makes five times the salary of our starting QB and WRs *combined*. It’s that this is the most profoundly talented collection of players you've never heard of. Sherm's a fifth rounder. Kam's sixth. Byron’s sixth. They are three of the four DBs who make up, arguably, the best secondary in league history. 3. **The anti-NW bias.** You might hear Seattle and Portland residents complain about an east coast bias. Let’s not bullshit: this is a real thing. And it’s particularly pronounced for teams in the Pacific Northwest – our games go late and our TV coverage is usually regional. You people outside the NW simply don’t pay attention. Which means you know less about our teams, which means you don’t take us as seriously. We're the left shoulder of the contiguous US, and we got a chip on us. 4. **“We play defense.”** We're proud that the Seahawks run the most innovative operation in football. From how Paul Allen trusts organizational leaders, to how Pete runs day to day operations, to how the organization built the most interactive fan experience in sports. We’re part of the game. We see it as our job. It’s a bit sick how much we invest in this team and push each other to do the same. But love makes you do crazy things sometimes. 5. **The truth…rocks.** There’s a little voice that terrorizes the minds of nearly all sports fans. That little voice of reality reminding you that your worst fears are probably true: your team is probably going to lose. Know what that voice is called? The truth. Seattle fans know that voice. But here’s the thing about the 2013-14 Hawks – for most of us, our truth voice is saying the Seahawks *are* the best team in football. And deep down in places you don’t talk about at sports bars, your truth voice is saying the same thing. Doesn't mean we think the Hawks are guaranteed a win; it *does* mean we know the Hawks will win if they play their best game. And that’s an exciting feeling. Any questions? EDIT: RS was HS salutatorian, not valedictorian. Thx to /u/dmhof.",

It was something along the lines of \"most women don't need to pay for sex because they can easily get someone who wants to do it for free.\" And that answer was accepted to be common knowledge, among normal people who didn't strike me as niceguys or incels.I then asked the follow-up question of \"doesn't that seem like an unfair advantage?\" And the answers were a little bit more varied. Some said it makes perfect sense because \"most women don't want casual sex\" or \"sex is inherently riskier for women\" (which I don't necessarily agree with because it would enforce gender stereotypes and slut shaming). But some of them said \"yeah it's unfair, but life isn't fair so who cares?\" And that struck me as rather defeatist. I try to avoid being cynical when I can, so I thought, surely there exists some kind of social movement to try to change this highly traditionalistic social dynamic, wherein \"all the men just want sex\" and \"all the women hold themselves to a higher standard than men\"? Surely it would be worthwhile to create a society in which everyone has the same chance of getting into the kind of relationship they want, given the large percentage of the population that seems to always be complaining about being lonely? Surely, if so many equality-minded social movements have already been waged, there is room for this one?For the record I am asexual and I don't have any personal stake in this matter, but with all the mentions of the \"manosphere\" in the news lately, I have been wanting to put this question to rest: either by giving hope to the lonely boys that there exists a way for them to receive equal treatment; or by articulating a cohesive reason that social traditions just have to stay.",

I was supposed to get an apartment on the second floor but due to miscommunication on my part the landlord gave it to another renter. He offered me an apartment on the third floor for the same price as the one on the second. He said that there was no difference between the two other than it being \"bigger \". I, somewhat foolishly, trusted him and gave him a months rent and the security deposit. We signed the receipt. And I moved in a few days later. Come to find out when I moved in but the place is nothing like I expected it. There were two open windows they could not be shot that the landlord did nothing about it until I pressed him and he fixed one, finally. There was no mirror in the bathroom, the floor was completely torn up with missing tiles and rotting wood, The refrigerator, though he said it was okay, wouldn't keep things cold and I've had milk go rotten on me. And the place was infested with roaches from the previous tenant and the people who live underneath me. He never hired an exterminator and just gave me a few traps and some boric acid. I still have a wide open window, the bathroom is still trash, and the fridge is still broken. After a month of him giving me half assed excuses and putting off fixing things I decided it was enough and found another place to live. I informed him  the end of this months rent term that I was moving and I want my security deposit back. He seems reluctant to issue it to me. Now it's not a major issue yet, but if it does become one I'd just like to know what my options are and what my rights are should he decide to be a hard ass.",

I haven't allowed myself to think about the events that I'm about to tell you in years. Resurfacing them gives me an anxious, almost haunted feeling.Three years ago, my best friend took his life. Since I was the last person he had spoken to and since our relationship had always had a bit of a toxic nature, the police questioned me and searched my phone to see if I had somehow brought on his actions. They left me alone, and my mental health declined very very rapidly. So did my physical health.. I was essentially dying of a broken heart. My close friends and family saw this, and naturally blew up my phone. That's when it started happening. That's when the noises appeared, and I swear even thinking about them sends me into a panic. My best friend had drowned himself. And after that, everytime I was on the phone even for a few seconds, the call would cut out like I lost signal and I swear I could hear what my brain interpreted as drowning sounds. I tried to contact my phone company, but they couldn't find any reason or proof that it was happening. When I mentioned it to a friend, she had two ideas: either solar flares (which were happening around that time), or that law enforcement had tapped my phone line to see if I had somehow encouraged this even though I'd contacted them 2 times in 24 hours before he began threatening the safety of my family as well as himself. They only cared when it was too late.ANYWAY, it kept happening and everytime I tried to make it happen around my mom, it didn't. I started avoiding phone calls altogether, which isn't a good idea after a major trauma because support is so important. So my very religious grandmother blessed my phone with holy water. It still happened for the few hours I had access to my phone before I was put in a mental hospital due to a suicide attempt. I find it important to note that I was not diagnosed with any sort of psychosis or hallucinations, but I was diagnosed with PTSD. I started antidepressants. And upon release, I slowly worked up the courage to call a therapist and start treatment. My phone didn't make the noise. It was as if it had never happened.I have replayed the events and tried to understand. I've considered that maybe I was a bit delusional and imagined the noises, but I swear they were very very real. I have tried to shrug it off as bad signal, but my phone works perfectly fine now. It has not happened since.... so what the hell was it? ",

I'm coming from a shitty HP pre-built from 2009 with Windows Vista and a Geforce 9500 GS. It's crap. I want this machine so badly to redeem the lost years. You better believe I'm buying as many AAA titles that I can get my hands on. Realistically, though, I'll probably spend most of my time with modded Skyrim, GTA V, and Garry's Mod (lol).Recently introduced to the Xeon E3-1231 v3. Just as good as an i7-4790 for a lower price. Definitely preferred hyperthreading for streaming and editing, but a good clockspeed for gaming as well. I have no interest in overclocking right now.GTX 980 because...well, GTX 980. I'll probably save some money purchasing it used from ebay or craigslist. I don't know. Wish me luck on that. Famous last words... D:1080p 144hz because it's great value and I'll get to take better advantage of that 144hz with a 980 as opposed to a 970 or a 290X. I'd love something like an XB270HU, but let's get real...Corsair 450D. Such a nice case. Pretty good price. The generic Devastator Bundle because it's fucking excellent value. I'll most likely upgrade to a mechanical keyboard in the future and a G502 or something...",

		"text": "Do we have any hint as to why there are so many different magic systems in Sel? We have AonDor, ChayShan, Dakhor, Forgey and Bloodsealing.A possibility is that they come from the interaction between Shards, much in the way Feruchemy is the combination of Preservation and Ruin. But even then there should be three systems, as in Scadrial. I see three possible explanations:- There can be more than one magic system resulting from two Shards. Depending on how much of each Shard there is in each system a different magic appears (kind of like in an alloy, perhaps).- Two of those systems are actually the same. Thus Bloodsealing and Forgey are the same system used differently (both use seals) and Dakhor and AonDor are the same system (both are baesd on writing things).- There is actually a third Shard at play. The last one is more unlikely to be true, but it is fun to consider. I furthermore propose that the third Shard is Odium! We know he's been on Sel and killed the other two Shardholders. Other points in favor are:- Dakhor monks have their bones deformed and hardened, to the point that they become under-skin armor. Who else had bone armor? The Parshendi, who we know are close to Odium (not that they were created by him, but we have WoB that they were not of Odium *originally*, so that might be taken to mean that they are now)- Dakhor monks access their magic system by chanting. Parshendi are known to chant as well, and IIRC the chanting had something to do with switching their form, as in it attracted the desired sprens or something.- Consider the Svrakiss. They are mythological spirits that are supposed to inhabit Sel and, get this:&gt; The Derethi believe that they had the ability to take over the bodies of living men and control their actionsSo this could simply be a legend or it could be a hint that they were Odium Splinters that possesed people in the same way that Voidsprens posses the Parshendi to bring them into stormform.- A minor, weaker point in favor: Dilaf is nothing if not full of irrational hatred against the Elantrians. Irrational hate doesn't need magic to exist, of course, but the continuous use of Odium magic could have amplified his to that point. Just saying.A reasonable objection is that it is hard for Shards to leave a Shardworld if they have left some of their power there, but maybe he didn't actually leave much (if any)  Investiture there. That would explain - why we have seen (so far) only five systems and not the six that would result from the pair-wise combination of three Shards (or seven, if there can be a magic system resulting from the combo of three Shards), - why the Svrakiss are now a legend (he took them all with him) and also - why Dakhor and Bloodsealing need sacrificies and blood, respectively, instead of tapping the Dor. They need to get Investiture from somewhere, so they take it from living things. Obviously drawing some blood would give you much less Investiture than sacrificing someone, but we have been told that Forgery uses comparatively little Investiture, so it is plausible that Bloodsealing does as well.",

A fusion or Falcon are two other options that Ford needs in its lineup to have conquest sales and I think personally, Ford should re-look at what is going on.  A 4 door large preformance sedan that is a completely new nameplate would bring life to the brand and add in alot of what the taurus was missing. I can understand getting rid of the c max, fiesta and taurus as they did not sell, but the fusion, focus and not having a larger sedan replacement is a horrid idea.Hopefully ford will not follow the same path with Lincoln too, supposedly the mkz will be replaced with something better and the next gen continental gets suicide doors ",

After I changed to it, I kinda wanted to use war to spread Technocracy but that idea was scrapped fast cause I was small as fuck. And from there Kansaska kept doing rocketry. After Russia fell I planned to create an [NPC](http://i.imgur.com/oNGy4VV.png) in the Technocratic District that old Russia made(check the fact book), but new russia came so I had to scrap that idea for land on the Black Sea, after a failed invasion from North Africa, I decided to give it to New Commonwealth cause he would have gone to war for it in the future so I might as well get something out of it. Also in Europe Denmark was organised into a new nation and while voting on government Technocracy won, this was the first Technocracy proclaimed by a player, Not gonna lie when I saw that I was hype. And a little after that Scandia turned technocratic, and after that Scandinavia. I was glad to see Technocracy spread and happier it happened in the same area. The [Copenhagen Meeting](http://www.reddit.com/r/WastelandPowers/comments/2ucv1e/news_copenhagen_technoctac_meetingorp/)  was a great fun, it let me talk about the systems each nation had. Turns out Technocracy is different in ever nation, same overall concept but different ways of achieving the goal. It was nice to see others take my concepts and run with it. So thanks to all the players who did something with Technocracy, if you had a technocratic party in your nation you count as someone.  I'm glad I was able to play this game, while I never made it to my destination the journey was worth it.",

Now, a common piece of advice given by people here is to take the time to get used to a new pair before judging whether it's to your satisfaction or not. I'm kinda afraid that initial impressions will not hold up - for example, I did not personally like the kind of sound the HD800 (with HDVD 800 amp) had during the 15 minutes I listened to a part of my playlist, but immensely enjoyed the next 15 minutes of listening to the same part of the playlist with an HD650 with the same amp. I have no way to tell whether such impressions will change over time. Other than visiting the same shop for days on end and hogging a certain model for hours at a time, what other ways of evaluating headphones are there? Or am I simply leaning more towards the 650?",

I had had a huge crush on him back in the day, but he wasn't interested so while we spent a ton of time together and flirted, we never dated. We exchanged phone numbers and decided to meet up for lunch to catch up as old friends at the end of July. Neither he nor I had texted much prior to that, so it wasn't like anything was building up. We went out to lunch, it was a nice time catching up, but romantically wouldn't be interested in him. But during the lunch, he started to treat it more date-like (talked about how it's been hard OLDing these past few years, bringing up the past moments we had together as kids, walking me to my car out of the way, lingering hug, etc.)... like I could just tell, you know? I later texted that it was nice to catch up. He wanted to meet up again fairly soon, I brushed it off with a soft rejection and said the next few weeks are going to be tough for me and I'm not going to be fun to be around/up for company.Originally I had considered meeting up again as friends, but after more consideration, I don't think I want to. Because, unlike a couple other guy friends who I've reconnected with, I can tell that it's not strictly platonic on his end. And I'm not interested in him as an adult, and wouldn't be.He's texted again about making plans (so, second time in about a week and a half since we had met up), and I am at a loss for how to respond. I left it for a couple of days, and he sent a snap chat last night 'reminiscing' about high school--like 'brings back the memories!' type snap. I don't want to just completely ghost/not respond--that would be incredibly rude, he's not doing anything wrong, and he's an old friend. But what in the world should I say? I'm at a complete loss. **Edit:** Thank you all so much for the direct approach wording ideas! The text is done and sent, and he sent a nice reply back and was understanding about it.",

[How many times did I step away from the game and come back to play that game again instead of a different one?]* ~~~~~ Score: 75/100 ~~~~~This game is by no means addictive to me.  If anything, it’s a comfort-food game.  Don’t know what to play?  Eh, let’s just throw on some Rocket League.  Some of you reading this review may know that I stream on Twitch, and this is almost never the first game that I play, and I rarely play it for more than 45 minutes at a time.  Unless I have friends that play it, and they ask me to play it with them, I usually just leave it be in my library.  WITH THAT SAID, this game is a very understanding and tender lover.  I may leave it for a time, but I’ll come back to it before going to a different and arguably better title...then find myself scraping across the ground to come back to Rocket League to dress my wounds.I feel that anyone, once he/she gets his/her fill (~100-200 hours, unless they are very gifted at the game), will quickly think that they have experienced everything that Rocket League has to offer.  It’s because they HAVE experienced everything the game has to offer.  It’s a side-dish of a game if anything.  I very much feel that unless huge changes are made or added to the game, it will die with a whimper in less than 2 years.**————————————————–***How long did I play the game in total at the time of making this review?*~~~~~ Score: 85/100 ~~~~~Total Hours Played - Score: 80/80I currently have 306 hours clocked into Rocket League.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, and I’ll probably get at least another 100 hours out of the game before I decide that I’m going to set it down for longer than 2 weeks.  Like I said, comfort-food.Hours Per Session - Score: 5/20Except for the first month, I seldomly played this game longer than 45 minutes at a time.  I never played any amount of this game and thought ‘well, I got my gaming fix for the day’.  If anything, I got rid of my Rocket League craving for the day and switched to something that was a bit more substantial...like nearly every other popular game in existence.  This score is based on how much a game curbs my appetite for all games instead of just its vain self.**————————————————–***How much content is there?  Did it feel like a complete, undivided experience? Did it have depth? [Hours of playtime:things to do and ways to do them, etc.]*~~~~~ Score: 30/100 ~~~~~The amount of things to do is laughable.  This game is sparse.  It’s so horrendously bad in terms of volume of content, it’s what causes my lack of consistent playtime.  What it does, it does exceedingly well, better than any other game of it’s type.  However, there is one mode; others seem to be temporary and based on seasonal things like the Snow-Day playlist.  Psyonix, add things to the fucking game and make it permanent.You effectively have one map with different skins that all operate the same way.  Oh, I apologize, there’s that one Mad Max flavored map that made the edges of the field beveled and they clicked to resize it.  Just look up SARPBC, the spiritual predecessor to Rocket League and check out the variety of maps in that game.  Then, ask yourself...why aren’t those maps in Rocket League?  I’ll tell you.I can’t prove it, but I have a very strong tinfoil-hat theory that this game was made to be an easy-access E-Sport, and Sony believed that they could make money on that fact in the long run.  Sony made this game free on PS+ for the first month of its release to get as many people into this emerging E-Sport as possible.  Rocket League is a game that anyone could watch it and understand what’s happening.  Why?  There’s no fucking depth.  The Objective: Score points.  That’s it.  There’s nothing else that you could do to make the game simpler than that other than dumbing it down even more to a ‘let’s see who has the prettiest flight pattern’.Don’t even talk about Mutator Mashup, or I’ll dock even more points off the final score.  Mutators are so shit and so basic, they shouldn’t even be in the game.  It’s like Psyonix was trolling or putting in sliders as an excuse for adding depth and content when all Mutators do is make the game hilarious or really fucking annoying.**————————————————–***How engaged did I become?  How much of an impact did it have on me?*~~~~~ Score: 90/100 ~~~~~I’m almost always thoroughly engaged and invested into the game when I’m playing it.  In terms of impact, I will remember it forever much like Super Mario, or Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies, or Crazy Taxi, or Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  This game is far from forgettable, but on the same token, it’s far from memorable.  Let me explain.Every single match is the exact same as the one previous.  At first, everything seems new and player movements seem too calculated for you to comprehend...then you get 50-100 hours in and you see the patterns, what you need to search for to have a good counter, player rotation, boost-stealing, setups, aerials...everything quickly becomes very automatic.  If this game was wiped off the planet in 2 years (when I think it will die if it won’t change any), people won’t remember much more than just the premise, which is sad to me.**————————————————–***How well were things explained? [Was the story captivating and the mechanics understandable?]*~~~~~ Score: 30/100 ~~~~~Mechanics - Score: 30/35The tutorial was pretty much garbage.  You’ll learn the most in multiplayer, primarily, then in the challenges.  The reason I didn’t dock this more is because the mechanics are so simple and few in number that the tutorial is barely necessary anyways.Story/Lore - Score: 0/65There’s no story.  There’s no lore.  There is nothing to keep you invested in the game besides the very repetitive and sparse gameplay itself.  That’s not good.  Oh, and the unlocks.  Forgot about dem cosmetics, tho.**————————————————–***How was the gameplay?*~~~~~ Score: 100/100 ~~~~~What little is there is very, very good.  The controls are tight and intuitive, the physics is predictable (as it should be), the play is fast-paced and MOST of the time, everything is seamless.  When I’m in the game, I’m IN the game, very focused, very competitive...at least for a little while as explained above.**————————————————–***How much were my senses tickled?*~~~~~ Score: 90/100 ~~~~~SFX - Score:10/10Every sound that this game was beautiful, well-designed, perfectly timed, satisfying...ugh.  Very good job.  I couldn’t give you more praise on this, Psyonix.Soundtrack - Score: 10/20Ask me about Rocket Leauge’s soundtrack, and I’ll tell you that it has one.  The songs don’t really stand out.  They aren’t bad and they aren’t as bland as elevator music, but I only ever listen to the soundtrack if there are additions before feeling underwhelmed and switching to my own music.  To be fair, it would be difficult to have a cinematic playlist perfectly suited for this game, so I commend the effort, but it falls quite short.  Just listen to your own music if you decide to play this game.Voice Acting - Score: 20/20Ask me about Rocket League’s voice acting, and I’ll reply with ‘Do you mean the crowd chanting?’.  I’m not saying that this game is even in need of voice-acting.  If anything, voice-acting would probably make this game worse and all kinds of cheesy, which is why it gets a perfect score for having none.Graphics - Score: 20/20There is really no denying that this is a beautiful game.  Everything has a really good mix between realism and stylization; all the effects and shaders and textures and models look great without being overboard and causing visual fatigue, and it just looks good.Controllability -Score: 30/30Although controllability isn’t the best, it’s good enough to deserve a perfect score.  The main thing with which I’m concerned is the maneuverability differences between vehicles.  Some have a tighter turning/flying radius than others which gives some vehicles a distinct advantage.**————————————————–***How few bugs were there? [Any glitches in the game negatively impact the score based on how much they ‘broke’ the game or ruined my experience. After first week only.]*~~~~~ Score: 70/100 ~~~~~This game, for the most part, is relatively free of game-breaking bugs.  A few still come up, though, and usually they are the same ones that happened months ago.  Server problems are the most prominent where things happening on day 1 still happen to me (though with less frequency) at least once every time that I play the game.  Then I’ll have (maybe a few times in 10 hours) unexplained game-crashes, stuttering, freezing, teleporting in game, sliding, unregistered goals, and any number of things that just leaves my screaming to my viewers PSYONIX, WHY?  I THOUGHT THAT YOU FIXED THIS MONTHS AGO!???Oh, and before you think about blaming me for MY internet connection...here ya go;  http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5017752485**————————————————–***Availability and diversity of settings?*~~~~~ Score: 90/100 ~~~~~The settings for graphics gives you a lot of options, but not enough for those like me who really want to tweak every detail, or those with less than stellar systems who can still barely run the game with everything on low.  For me, having to edit the text files to unlock the framerate?  What?  Fucking WHAT?  Other studios do it too, so I’m not necessarily mad at Psyduck, more just the practice itself.Adjusting the camera settings for your 3rd person view of your vehicle was a great, amazing, wonderful touch and it’s what kept the score for this category as high as it is.  I was able to get everything looking and feeling exactly the way that I wanted, and that is so prudent to this game to get any amount of competitive edge.**————————————————–***How was the optimization? [ Size of files, ability to run smoothly, etc.] *~~~~~ Score: 65/100 ~~~~~Sizes - Score: 25/30Taking into account that this game barely has anything in it at all?  I had to tone this one back a bit because, even though it may feel like 10+ gigabytes in size, it’s really only about 3GB.  Nicely done.Performance - Score: 40/70For this one, as usual, I run various stress tests before during and after playing the game to get an idea how it affects my system and the game.  I have a fairly beefy rig ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/TqTJK8 ) and this game runs well, max settings on everything and unlocked frames getting about 120 of them...but the temperatures...oh my gosh, why?  I even suffered a bit of performance by factory clocking everything and trying again, getting fewer frames and only marginally better temperatures.  Multitasking and playing this game is a no-no.  Just don’t do it unless you have a rig similar to mine.  Luckily, my system is well-cooled, so I don’t have to worry about long play sessions, but yours better be as well or you might have some computer freezes after a few hours.During online play versus offline, the main difference is the framerate.  When you get near the 144Hz mark, online versus offline with a good system could be the difference between 20 frames.  Keep that in mind.In general, I have no idea when this game will and won’t be stable, but it IS stable more often than not.**————————————————–**EXTRA REPRIMAND~~~~~ Score: -5/100 ~~~~~Performance At Launch [First week only.] - Score: -0/20The game was playable for most people, albeit annoying for the first week, without anything too detrimental besides the server hassle.  This is meant if anything made the game unplayable for a portion or the majority of the first week of launch.DLC/Microtransaction - Score: -5/20Although, for the most part, the microtransactions are benign, the Supersonic Fury pack is basically required if you want to get a car (Dominus) that, pros agree, is the best vehicle if you don’t like Octane.  When you have different car models, it’s hard to keep all things equal, but a better job could be done.  If you try and argue with me, or a lot of people that say the same thing, watch the pros play and you will very, very quickly see that most are playing one of 3-4 different vehicles out of the 13 available after you buy all DLC.Customizability - Score: -0/20This usually pertains to cosmetics and the game as a whole.  They get extra credit.Community Correspondence - Score: -0/20To me, keeping engaged with the community is very important and necessary, without warranting its own category, and Psyduck has done a very good job about keeping in touch.Promises - Score: -0/20They didn’t make many promises, and they kept the ones that they made (as far as I know with a little digging).  No reprimand.  This section is if studios promised us something or led us to believe another thing (graphical downgrade, for instance) then stole the rug from under us.**————————————————–**EXTRA CREDIT~~~~~ Score: 50/100 ~~~~~Performance At Launch [First week only.] - Score: 0/20This category is for those games that really stand out as a testament to attentiveness to detail.  When taking into account the actual size and scope of the game and the number of developers that were working on it, I’m surprised it wasn’t worse.  However, it wasn’t better than my standard of expectations when thinking about awarding extra credit.DLC/Microtransaction - Score: 20/20This category is also for if they had fairly priced and worthwhile DLC.  For the most part, at least the things for which you pay, have been pretty okay, nothing too grand.  They get extra credit (which is sad since it should be common practice) for releasing the BIG ticket items like maps and game-modes...for free.  GGPsyduck.Customizability - Score: 15/20Although you are still restricted as to HOW MUCH you can customize your vehicle and other settings in the gameCross-Platform - Score: 15/20Although I’m a PCMR kinda guy, I still hate when my system gets exclusives.  I went on a whole rant about it several times in various forums and I just think it’s bad for the consumer.  They didn’t get the full 20 because of the delayed release for the XBox (when the game is slowly dying as it is), but at least it’s a very good step in the right directions.Promises - Score: 0/20Like I said, I didn’t notice anything that Psyonix did that was too impressive for this category.  This section is for studios that promise something grand and innovative, then actually follow through.**==============================****==============================****~~~~~ Final Score: 770 / 1,000 ~~~~~****==============================**In the end, this game is worth every penny ($20 USD), but I’m still upset about some of the frequent missteps taken by Psyonix.  I do have to take into account that the dev team (last time that I checked) was 12 people, so I have to admit that everything is impressive when that is understood, but I still rate a game based on the game itself.  There isn’t much else to say about this game that I haven’t said already, which is sad because I wanted to praise this game for what it could be...but I’ll destroy this game for what it is...and I can’t quite do that either.  It’s a good time-waster, but I doubt that (unless changes or additions are made) this game will resonate within most people to really keep playing and playing and replaying and resetting and playing it again.  It doesn’t have that charm for me.",

And they've all gone relatively well, but the issue is I don't know how to keep the conversation going past the initial exchange. Usually with a girl, I just read her body language and exit gracefully because she's heading somewhere and just wanted to be courteous but with some girls I genuinely felt like we could've had more of a dialogue/maybe swap numbers but I got a bit tongue-twisted and just ran out of stuff to say. So basically, how do you keep the conversation going and build a rapport for someone you just met for the first time? What are some go-to topics that you pull out to renew interest if/when it starts to get awkward? Thanks! :)",

		"text": "**Welcome back, everyone! People seemed to enjoy the content/ discussion of last week's post, so I figured I'd give it another go! This week's feature: Mina!***Disclaimer: this is not an entirely linear comparison. Anime/ quirk worldbuilding defies what is possible by reality's standards; this is merely a fun little examination of theory. Hope you enjoy!*Oh boy, this is going to be a mess. While not having the *most* unrealistic quirk (that award probably goes to someone like Tokoyami or Aizawa), Ashido's quirk is really hard to rationalize but let's dive in!Even on the surface, Ashido's anatomy and physiology are starkly different from most of her peers in 1A (inb4 comments of *THICC*). She has pink hair/ skin, the whites of her eyes are black, golden colored irises, and curved horns. Curved. Horns. (idk they might be antennae?)Still, the most insane thing about her is absolutely her Quirk. Acid is an extremely powerful quirk and Ashido is seemingly capable of producing this from wherever she chooses on her skin, as demonstrated by secreting it from both her hands and her feet. This does not seem to have harmful effects on her person, though I believe that it is the reason she is pink (more on this later).Mina's acid is obscenely strong (like seriously has to have a pKa in the negatives) and it is fairly unlikely that it is a singular compound, rather that it is a cocktail of several different kinds of acid working together. This is due to the variety of metal materials she seems to be able to dissolve.Not all metals can be dissolved by a single acid, such as gold and platinum but can be dissolved by a mixture of two acids, HNO3 and HCl in a 1:3 ratio (known as aqua regia) through the following reaction:Au(*s*) + HNO3 + 4 HCl ⇌ [AuCl4]^− (*aq*) + [NO] + [H3O]^+ + H2OAt the very least, Mina's acid is complex/ strong enough to dissolve stainless steel easily. As a general note, this Quirk would be uncommonly dangerous to use against a human. Even when acids don't literally burn through tissue (which Mina's absolutely would), they cause harmful effects to the human body with proton/ anion donation. There is hardly enough PPE in the world to stop Aoyama from suffering substantially when Mina acidifies his belt in the Sports Festival.Likewise, unless all of Mina's cells are lined with Teflon/ some fluorocarbon, she would suffer serious side effects from carrying around that much acid in her body. I'm not even going to get in to how much that conflicts with reality's biological principles but you see the same with Bakugo as well. In my last post, I talked about how Bakugo's nitroglycerin would act as a vasodilator like how it is used in medicine. The amount he'd be producing would very likely kill him.But why is Mina pink? Well, it is possible that her body contains an organic compound which produces that coloration (possibly akin to phenolphthalein?), though I think it is equally possible that 1) Mina's skin contains a larger quantity of Manganese than normal, possibly to be used as some sort of ligand for biological processes (this is a huge stretch) and 2) part of the \"acid cocktail\" as we called it is sulfuric acid.If that's the case, her acid could undergo a reduction reaction with the Manganese in her skin, producing Mn^2+ ions. Transition metals absorb different types of light depending on the configuration of electrons in the d-orbital of the electron cloud. This configuration produces a light pink coloration, much like Ashido's skin tone.Man, I told you guys this was going to be a mess! Ashido's Quirk and biology clearly differ from reality enough on a *fundamental level* just so she isn't seriously crippled or killed by her own Quirk. I find that utterly fascinating!",

It helps a bit, but I'm still struggling with getting things done around the house and just life in general. I also have an appointment on Monday with my sleep doc for a check-up to see how the modafinil is working. I wanted to mention maybe trying Adderall to her because I've read some of your posts about how much it has helped you guys. The reason I asked about the Xyrem is because my therapist suggested maybe it would be better to treat the root of the problem (getting proper sleep) instead of trying to treat the symptoms.I was on Xyrem before and I guess it helped but it wasn't a miracle drug for me. I still struggled to get things done. I also got crazy munchies from it. I stopped when my insurance company told me it wasn't a necessity and they weren't going to cover it anymore.

Anyway...There was a scene recently where one of the male CIA spies gets fall-down drunk alone at an American hotel and is approached by a female hotel manager. She lectures him about his etiquette for a moment, sees him struggling to try to get up and orient himself, and she yells \"Wow, you're reeeally drunk!\" The scene immediately cuts to them having sex, her riding on top, completely sober. He's into it, but I found it really interesting, especially given her looks, which I won't go too far into detail, suffice to say she's not in amazing shape. He takes her out for breakfast the next morning.I really wish I could figure out the intention of this scene from the writers, beyond a new romance for a supporting character. In some ways, it feels like a direct reference to California's new \"drunk sex does not equal consent\" law (good). Another interpretation is that it's okay for sober women to have sex with drunk men (bad)... There's just too many good or bad messages from it, that it really interested me.Lemme know your thoughts if you saw it.",

		"text": "Hey r/summonerschool.My name's Shadyblink and this is my account on Euw; http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=%CE%94%20Azir%20%CE%94 So I made it to Diamond V yesterday after starting off in Bronze V in Season 3. I currently main Azir and Shaco. If you have any questions about these Champions, shoot.  I played tons of Ranked games and I know a lot about the game. Therefore, I'm gonna try to share my knowledge. This is gonna be in 3 different forms: 1. General tips - 2. Rank specific Tips - 3. Role specific tips. 1 General Tips:- This is the most important thing in my opinion. Stick to one or two roles &amp; 2-3 Main Champions. For me these are Jungle/Mid with Shaco/Azir. I know everything about those Champions. Why is that so important tho? Knowing everything about a champion allows you to make combo's without thinking about it, which allows you to focus on other stuff. (Watching minimap/Csing) So it's very very important to main a role. BUT, you should be able to play EVERY role up to a decent level. So find that 1-2 Champions which you LOVE and train them in normals.- ACCEPT that you cannot win every game. This is so important. I had games where my stats were 18-2 and I lost. It's hearbreaking and frustrating. It's \"elohell\" (nah jk elohell doesnt exist). Most players stick around 50-56% winrate. Which basically means you lose every second game. This is fine. Because sometimes you will win 2 in a row which makes you climb. - If you really want to climb, you have to play a lot. You might be of gold skill level atm, but only silver because you don't play enough ranked games. If you want to climb, play more ranked. But only with champions which you are good at. Normals are fun, to train or just play taric jungle.- Runes &amp; Masteries. Having the right runes can change your lane a lot. Check out www.probuilds.net to use the same runes/masteries setup as the pros. Adjust your choice of runes vs your opponent. This for example means, if you're playing mid against leblanc, you should go with magic resist glyphs instead of ap scaling glyphs, to make sure that you don't die too fast, or not at all.- Use your dodges. I suggest to dodge twice a day if necessary. Losing 3LP or even 10LP is still better than wasting 20-50 minutes and losing 15-25 LP. This means dodge, when a troll is in your champ select, or if you simply feel like you lost the game in Champ Select. Example: For me I dodge when I have a comp like: Riven Top, Yasuo mid, Lee Sin Jungle, Vayne Adc. These are all HIGH skill champs, and I doubt all my teammates mastered them.- Play to improve, not to win. Make sure you play your best in every game, even if you are losing. The only thing which remains the same in EVERY game, is you. You will always play in your games.- Accept that it's nearly impossible to carry solo. Work as a team, encourage your team to not give up. No games are lost. Season 5 is all about objective control, getting dragons, baron, turrets, inhibs etc. 5th dragon can make you win vs their fed team.- Let yourself be carried. Sometimes you have bad games. You'll lose lane. This doesn't mean the game is lost. Your team might be able to pick up your bad performance. So let yourself get carried. Build something defensive and try to be usefull.2 - Let's go over to Rank Specific Tips:- Bronze: First of all, admit that you suck at the game. You need to improve in every area possible. Watch videos on youtube (search for stuff like \"tips for bronze), watch streamers. You literally have to improve everything. Don't even think about saying \"my \"instertanychamphere\" is good tho.\" NO, YOURE NOT GOOD. YOU SUCK HARD. You are the lowest tier shit of this game. This is so important, to really accept the fact that you're not good at all at the game and that you need to improve. I suggest to play easy champions. These are for example: Annie Midlane/Support (No mechanics required) - Darius Top - Xin Zhao Jungle - Sivir/Tristana Adc. Those are basic, easy to understand Champions, with a straight up kit. No bullshit. Learn these champions and you'll be silver soon. - Silver: Aw yiss, I'm Silver. Im good. NO. You're in the league in which most of the players are. You are now literally average trash at this game. Accept it. Improve. What can you improve on? Csing. This is so important. Imagine there's free money lying around on the street: VOILA, that's how csing works. Every creep is free moneys. So you can build those tasty items and carry. This leads to my second point: ITEMIZATION. Again: probuilds.net to see the best items for champions. This doesnt mean you should build every item every game. Lemme give you an example.As Azir, I check the enemy team. If there's an ap Assassin I most likely get chalice/abyssal sceptre instead of morello, to make sure I have some MR, to avoid getting oneshot. Is their adc fed, or do I need to engage (Shurima Shuffle), if so, Zhonyas is a must (It's nearly always but euh). Then, Are they squishi? If so : Ludens for more burst, tanky? Liandries. etc. etc. This should be your thought process on every champion. All ad? Better build Banshees. You get the point right? ( PLS DONT BUILD BANSHEES AGAINST AD I WAS KIDDING)- Gold:Roam/Objective Control/Teamwork - So you're Gold now. Shiny bronze huh? You know some stuff about the game alright. Still, it's gold. You need better decision making - This means, how do I properly trade in lane? Can I kill the enemy? Where's the enemy jungler? All that stuff. Improve your map awareness and make sure to ask yourself more questions while playing. - Platinum:Well, to be fair, I was in Plat for a long time. So... I think what made me get out of it was warding. No kidding. Since I started playing midlane, I understand how important warding is. I am dying MUCH less to ganks since I started warding, and personally improved my map awareness. As a jungler, don't be afraid to ward too. But well. Still, fix your champion pool, learn your champion PROPERLY (NOT 10 normal games, I'm talking about 50-60 games) and rek shit.3 Role specific tips:- Support: You carry the first few levels on botlane. No one else does. You are the one winning/losing the lane 90% of the time pre 6. You lane pressure is important. Your decision making on engaging can win/lose the lane. Ward everything up. Buy a pink when you are ahead. Don't flame your adc. Roam midlane when possible (this is very good). Ward dragon. give your jungler a good leash. Sighstone please + Red upgraded trinket. Locket agains ap mid.- Adc: Focus on Csing. Know how to trade (Auto when then enemy is going in for a creep). FOCUS ON CSING. Don't be bot for 30 minutes of the game. Go mid if needed. Deny Cs when taking the turret. (Let creeps die before killing turret). Positioning is everything as adc. Dont facecheck. Buy blue trinket. Get BT before LW if its an even game, if ahead LW. Dont be afraid to get an early QSS (3rd item) or a GA against reset champs (Katarina). Your goal is to attack whatever you can reach, not the enemy adc (only if completely out of position). This mostly includes tanks. Itemize properly against the ennemy. No tanks? NO botrk. You are not the center of your team as adc. Adc's are pretty weak in S5, pre 30 minutes. It's a pain in the ass early, but you can carry hard late. Don't be a chicken in teamifghts. Your the ATTACK DAMAGE CARRY, now go and deal damage.- Toplane: TAKE TP. You know what's better than igniting your opponent in lane? Tping bot, getting a double kill + dragon. Ask your botlane to ward deep so you can tp. Be prepared to get camped and not get a single gank from your own jungler. Ward up please. IF you are behind build tank. I dont want my 0-5 wukong to rush hydra agains the 5-0 Riven. Please. Play a tank and tp bot. It's just the best thing you can do. - Jungle: Map awareness Please. Know where the enemy jungler is. Ward dragon + baron. Ward for your mid/toplaner. You're the bitch of the game. Just accept it. Don't counterjungle with a low mobility champ. Watch the minimap again. Now again. Jungling is not about taking jungle creeps. It's about map pressure. Every laner should be afraid of you. Red trinket mostly. Still buy wards, ward the enemy jungle for more information. Gank botlane a lot. It's the best way to get dragon control. HAVE DRAGON CONTROL. 5 dragons can instantly win you the game. don't be afraid to call for an early baron with a pink ward. A lot of players just don't expect you to go for that 23 minute baron. Can catch them off guard very easily.- Mid: WARD WARD WARD. Accept that your enemy might be better. Roam bot/top if youre pushing. Understand your matchup. Know your powerspike. (As azir i know, I will be a beast late, so I don't mind going 0-0 for 20 minutes). Focus on Csing. It's free moneyz. Try to know where the enemy jungler is. Be patient, you don't need to get kills. So yeah. I could write much more. I might pick up streaming again, to show more gameplay + answer questions, but I'm not sure if advertising your stream here is allowed. But, this is already a lot. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask themCheers.Edit; I'm currently streaming at www.twitch.tv/matthewdafoe makes is easier to answer all of your questions :)",

As a child, I had feelings of depression and a general melancholy \"neutral\" mood most of the time. This has continued up until now but seems to have gotten worse. I recognize that I may have clinical depression and am planning to see a psychiatrist. Before I do that, I want to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong (or if my thoughts can be changed). No matter what I do or experience, I am always feeling bored and anticipating something else. I could be sitting at the pool with friends and I'll probably be the only one ready to go back inside even though I know I'll be even more bored at home. Today I went shopping with a friend and after a couple of hours, I was ready to leave even though I wasn't looking forward to doing anything else. Even when I'm having what others would consider a good time, I feel bored and discontent. This same principle has applied to bigger circumstances like life goals, jobs, relationships, etc. Each time I achieve something new, I am surprised at how little it affects my happiness. It's like my brain is waiting for some big \"moment\" when suddenly I am going to find happiness externally. I know this isn't the case and want to find happiness internally, but it seems like I am incapable of this. I meditate, exercise, eat well and spend time with loved ones. I keep my house clean and do my best to keep myself put together. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just not seeing that I could change to find happiness?**TL;DR** I've always experienced extreme melancholy and boredom, even when doing things others would consider enjoyable. I take care of myself, exercise, meditate, eat well, and spend time with others including my loving fiance. I'm not sure what more I could do to find internal happiness. I keep waiting for a moment when I will, but it hasn't come yet, and I'm beginning to worry it won't. Am I just depressed? Or is there something I'm just missing?",

		"text": "I've been struggling with this the last few weeks. Honestly, what triggered it was the recent Stanford rape case, and whether or not drinking should be considered a cause. My whole life, for all the problems at home, I always blamed the alcohol. I watched it change my dad. My dad was so good sober (warm and friendly and proud), but became mean, violent, and abusive when he drank, which was usually. I saw my drunk dad as literally a different person from my sober dad, like a Jekyll and Hyde thing. Most other people don't change the same way, but they change, too, eventually distant and spacey with enough to drink. They're not themselves anymore. Or that's how I see it.  I've never been comfortable around other people drinking because of this, and I think it's totally because of this view.But, I've noticed in that when something bad happens and alcohol is involved (e.g., the rape case), everyone else seems to blame the person, not drinking. The claim is that alcohol brings their real selves out. Inhibitions are gone, so that's who they really were. Alcohol doesn't turn anyone evil. Drunk words are sober thoughts.It's led me to question a lot of what I had always thought about whether the bad thing was the alcohol or my father. Maybe thinking of drunk him as a different person was just a coping mechanism. So, in regards to my dad, and if the evil was in him, and not the drink...what am supposed to do with that? Was he really deep down a vicious person that wanted to hurt his own small kids? And the things he said, did he really think we were so worthless?The extension of this is to feel safer around many other people drinking, because they're not my dad, but then in some sense feel worse that even my own father would want to do that abuse to me. If that's the way it really was, so be it, coping with that realization is something different to work on in therapy. But I wanted to ask others' perspectives - ACOAs might have a different one from the general public - on whether you viewed the problem as stemming from the drink or the parent...or both?",

Also, watching the performance of Firefox get better and better was a plus. Up to this point, the deal-breaker that kept me away from FF was the lack of desktop app support, however the fact that FF can show taskbar previews of all tabs was a major pull. That, plus pinning my top 4 sites to the window everytime and being able to see them in the taskbar as well as see the small notification icons, brought me back very happily.Some concerns before I completely remove Chrome:- FF has no internal flash support. Chrome has its own. Is there any way to get support in FF without installing the Adobe junk?- I use Mega a lot for file sharing, and it utilizes some kind of memory method to get blazing fast downloads. I find that Chrome can handle it a lot better than FF. Is there anything I can do in FF to make multiple Mega downloads run more smoothly?Thanks, and it's good to be back!PS. Know of any good glass themes for the browser? I'd love to make it less opaque, without going completely black.",

Based on the commenting patterns on the first post, we're bumping up to a 2/week schedule.In case you missed them, the most recent FAQ Q&amp;A threads before this were:* [What birth control methods have you used, and what have been your experiences with them? Which is your favorite?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8g82ch/faq_qa_what_birth_control_methods_have_you_used/)* [How did you learn to say 'no' to people?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8h0jdp/faq_qa_how_did_you_learn_to_say_no_to_people/)* [What do and don't you want to see in a dating profile?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8hxhen/faq_qa_what_do_you_and_dont_you_want_to_see_in_a/)* [How do you handle your PMS/period symptoms?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8jqe4x/faq_qa_how_do_you_handle_your_pmsperiod_symptoms/)* [How did you develop self-confidence?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8khv5y/faq_qa_how_did_you_develop_selfconfidence/)These threads will be **HEAVILY MODERATED.** The point is to create an informative repository of answers for questions that get over-asked on the sub, and while AskWomen has never been a debate sub, the No Derailment rule will be applied particularly strictly in these threads in order to make them as densely relevant to the topic as possible.

Are there couples out there that find cuss words offensive or a turn off during sex? Maybe you actually like &amp; use these words during sex, or maybe you don't say them, but hearing your partner use them turns you on? I'm really curious how other couples feel about this. If for example (NSFW) on our honeymoon, or even after the wedding ceremony before the reception, if my fiancee were to grab me, kiss me hard &amp; whisper feverishly in my ear: \"fuck me baby, fuck your wife...\" I would prolly have a boner &amp; proceed to honor her request. In a sexual context, it would be a turn on. Outside the bedroom, or in casual convo, IDK. She knows I don't swear, mostly due to strict religious upbringing, but we haven't had sex before- I'm not sure how she'll react if I drop a F-bomb when I'm inside her for the first time cause she feels THAT GOOD. Maybe she'd take it as a compliment? IDK, she would be shocked tho, considering how religious I am. What about you guys? Do you find it distasteful? Have you had relationships where your partner was into it/not into it, or said it too much? Feel free to share, I would love to know your viewpoint/experience with this issue.",

The thing is, though, the children end up aging up waaaay too quickly and before I know it I have young adult parents and a young adult child - with a toddler on top of it. I end up having to cheat and manually age them up so everything stays in order. I just wish the aging process would integrate naturally in the game. Am I the only one who has this problem? In TS4 right now, I had to age up my parents in order to avoid having YA parents and a YA daughter. Generally, once one sim becomes a YA, I ditch the family and start finding a partner for the YA.

I just got some parts for my guitar, and I plan on modding the wiring a little, however I'm kind of having some troubles with it, so here goes my initial plan:The guitar has two humbuckers, a 3-way toggle, and two pots. I was thinking of having a master volume, with a blower switch on it since I like having the neck pickup on low volume for cleans.Instead of a tone pot (which I barely ever use anyway) I'd prefer a bass roll off, which is the right pot in the diagram (link below). The dotted line is cause I haven't added the resistor yet, I'll go to the shop and buy one tomorrow. With 500k pots, and the capacitor used on that pot being 2nF. However, right now when you turn the knob nothing happens.On the volume pot I also added a treble bleed (though maybe in the wrong order?) with a 1nF capacitor, and a 220k resistor. I might have to swap the order. If I wire it to a switch, there is no difference in sound between the two positions even with the rolled back volume. However, it drastically changes the taper of the pot, is that supposed to happen? Even if I wire it to a switch, the taper still changes. I used to have it wired to the back end of my tone control (diagram at the end) and it worked just fine. Will a Kinman style treble bleed always change the taper, or is it just the pot I use? It's the Allparts push/push 500k pot, it says A. Log Audio Taper on the Thomann website.If anyone has any insight, please let me know, thanks!Diagrams:My planned wiring, hope there's nothing too wrong with it!http://imgur.com/OU5HKV3The treble bleed wiring that I used, didn't seem to change the taper, but noticeable difference. Treble bleed is a 220k resistor and 1nF cap, bass roll-off is a 2nF cap (will add a 500k resistor in the indicated position to see if it will work properly).http://www.mylespaul.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=22926&amp;d=1268772996Thanks in advance!",

If it weren’t for this acne, I would be so much more excited for the summer where I could take my shirt off without shame, even pride. However, I have horrendous body acne. It actually wasn’t bad at all until only a couple months ago (when it got out of control extremely quickly) which I find weird, considering I’ve only treated it more.Partially on the surface of my skin, and some cystial acne with a lot on my back. It hurts— a lot. When I work out, and am lying on a bench, it hurts, and sometimes stains my shirt. When I’m sitting in class, it hurts, although thank god there’s not enough irritation for it to pop in class. In regards to my face, I’ve generally been able to keep it in check, although I have an “average” amount for a 16 year old.I’ve tried almost everything. Scrubs/washes? Done it- twice a day for months. Showering in the morning, and right after my workout. Doesn’t work. Creams? Works the first week, and loses its effect. Orals? Still am taking them after months, but they haven’t helped. The only reason I’m not stopping is because it will only get worse if I do. I’ve done just about everything and nothing is helping. If my acne was the way it was only a few months ago, I wouldn’t care because it was within the normal range. If anyone has any suggestions on how to proceed, please share them. Any related response is appreciated.Side note- my dermatologist has said it’s bad enough to justify Accutane use, however he wants to wait until September-October because of the sunny weather, assuming nothing else works.",

Even when I can \"logic\" the worst of these thoughts away I'm still afraid of the seeds she plants. Ever since I was a little kid she's deprived me of my ability to intrinsically believe other people and repeatedly attacked me through relaying the words and thoughts of others (which may or may not have ever been true), or mixed \"real\" behavior advice like \"people think that behavior is socially unacceptable\" (when it actually is) vs. the same phrase used to describe something that's fine or even conducive to good things. I'm just very frustrated. ",

However, this makes for shallow friendships/acquaintances. Sometimes I do feel like I really connect with people, but now it has gotten to the point where I doubt it when I do 'connect'. I've started dating again, and recently a few of my dates have told me they like me a lot, after only a few dates. But I am left wondering why. I can't distinguish if they like me for me, or if I've gotten so good at social engineering that they like me because of this. Anyone else struggle with feelings like these? I want to connect! But I don't trust that the connections are real.. TL;DR: struggling with being afraid I manipulate people, and they don't really like me for me. ",

I wanted a chocolate cake. \"Your cousin can't have chocolate, pick white\", my dad said. \"It's my birthday and I can't have a chocolate cake? We could just get him a smaller cake or cupcake or something or at least that for me\", I said back. \"No, that's too much food, we'll just get white\", he said. What was the point of asking then if I didn't have an option to begin with? Then for food I wanted BBQ. Guess what? \"Your cousin can't have most of that, we need to have things he can eat\", my dad said. At this point, I'm irritated. \"Then why are you asking me what *I* want, if it's just about what *[cousins name]* needs\", I asked back. \"Because it's *YOUR* birthday, you pick what you want\", he said. Not caring anymore, I suggested the most blandest food you could have at a party. The day of my birthday arrives and the food spread is pretty much a thanksgiving meal and my cake, my personal favorite, at my request, was a bland white cake with no icing and a picture that goes on top that would have been the heading of the cake. My cousins show and the mother of Mr. Allergic To Everything brought him his own fucking pizza. Like, a straight up large pizza hut pizza and mcdonalds because apparently that's the only things he can eat. He ate only that and wanted nothing else, not even cake. My dad then later tells me that I probably could have gotten the food I wanted. *scene of me eating a bland cake slice with a plastic knife like a fucking neanderthal*People who I told this to online think I'm an asshole for wanting things I wanted on a day about me when my cousin needed to be put first before me.",

The stats on salary from students who have gone through my university are about 56k starting for undergrad and 72k starting if they have a masters.Now I pretty much know for sure that I will be going to grad school eventually. Its just something I'd like to do. The difference is that if I do it right after graduating my degree will be a Masters of Science and include a thesis. If I get a job and work full time I will have to take it slower and would be given a Masters of Civil Engineering. The degrees are the same except the MCE does not include a thesis.My main concern: do employers think less of your masters degree if you did not have to do a thesis? I'm certainly not scared of doing a thesis, I'm more scared of going broke while trying to get my degree if I don't work while doing it.Do you guys have any thoughts/advice/related anecdotes that might help me make up my mind?",

I am using the techniques like how to draw a straight line and how to draw ellipses on my practice of drawing in perspective. I know this was going to be hard so I am not frustrated from that perspective. I am also not angry that I have to practice so much to get better. I also threw on the wheel and made pottery and remember how long it took me to just learn how to center clay on the wheel.The problem I am facing is that technical drawing and practicing seem very boring to me. It feels as if I have to go on and force myself to practice. So far what I do is i spend about 25-35 minutes on technical exercises such as practicing my lines, ellipses, and perspective and then spend about 30-40 minutes drawing from life. My ultimate goal is to be able to draw figures from my imagination and to also create characters as well. I know that is a long ways off from where I am right now but I dont know how I will reach that point if i keep on forcing myself to practice.  Again, I am not against practicing I just want to know if it meant to be this boring or am i just doing it wrong. I really want to go out to public places and draw and plan on doing that in the next few days.Another thing that bothers me is that I tend to value every page in my sketchbook to much. Like if i mess up on a picture I immediately want to give up, but i force myself to finish instead of just giving up and moving to a fresh page. Do you guys have any tips on how to cope with the fact that not every piece will be a masterpiece? Thanks for any comments in advance!",

Was hoping someone can suggest a few different types of fresh water fish that are good for beginners and can be housed together.

		"text": "One of the most intriguing ideas I've read on developing new habits is that you should start very small. How small? So small you can't fail: flossing just one tooth, running for one minute, reading one page of a book.You want to make sure your chosen behavior feels very achievable so you can focus on the *cue* and *reward* parts of the new habit instead of struggling with a difficult task. Increasing the scope of the behavior very gradually helps you maintain the familiarity that habits depend on.According to this philosophy, habits are just very familiar things you do repeatedly without having to exert much willpower at all. Over time you can go from someone who has the habit of just tying the laces of your running shoes to someone who runs 10 K without even thinking about it.Over the years this idea has been presented by many, many writers and speakers such as [Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/sticky/), [BJ Fogg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8) (video), [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/habit-guide), and [Stephen Guise](http://www.developgoodhabits.com/multiple-habits/), who gives a very useful rule of thumb on selecting the scope of activity you should start with:&gt; The best metric is, “could I still do all of these on my worst day?” If yes, then you’re in good shape, won’t miss days, and could actively develop as many as four new good habits at once. I don’t miss my mini habits on holidays, vacations, sick days, or anything else. They’re too easy to say no to.#### What very small habits have you implemented? What has been your experience with creating such small changes?",

I had already provided the recruitment agency with the contact information of a variety of former employers, character referees etc. For the most part, it is going well. My character reference is through. My previous employer's reference (let's call him Employer A, 1 year ago) is through. The one before that (Employer B, 2010-2013) is through as well. So I know I have at least 3 good references.Here is where it gets tricky though.My employer from even before that (Employer C, 2009), a man that knew me and had worked closely with me, has passed away. I have his written recommendation letter, though his son is now CEO of the company. His son is not the most moral of people, frankly he's a jerk. Along with the rest of my country (Greece), his company is in deep financial trouble. When I got the job with Employer A last year, they told me it would be nice if I could get a recommendation from Employer C that is more recent. Employer's C son didn't know me, and I knew it would be difficult for me to convince him to write it. However, when I contacted him and asked him for the reference, he pretty much told me I either had to bribe him to give me a positive reference, or he would bury me. The amount he asked was close to half a year's salaries. Simply impossible for me.I was lucky and Employer B's references were enough for Employer A in the end. The company I will be working on though now wants that reference. And I want to work for that company with all my heart, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.I am a bit lost and very worried I might lose the position because of him. Any advice on how I can proceed, on either side (Employer C or company)?",

The W acts as a barricade for you and you team, but it's useless if a Zed can walk through it to get to your ADC and press W to avoid stun.

But.We ended up spending a lot of the discussion talking about \"reverse discrimination,\" basically. We started because there's this scene where a masculine lesbian is telling her (straight) friend that she's been harassed in public, and this well-meaning but naive friend goes on to ask why she dresses so masculinely. He tells her that it's not that people should mistreat her, but she's also making a choice that causes it to happen. I feel like the show does a good job of condemning this view while still being compassionate towards a character who does honestly mean well, but my dad instead agreed with this friend. We ended up spending most of the conversation talking about his sense that some queer people have become the bigots and hate people like him. It was just really frustrating. It's not that minorities can never hate people in the majority, or that there aren't queer people who display the same bigotry towards straight people that they're condemning in the first place. But when you're talking about a play that showcases the struggles of queer people, turning the discussion into a \"don't get so militant that you hate me for being straight\" conversation just feels so \"I need everything to be about me.\"The whole conversation left me feeling really frustrating and upset, and I can't seem to shake it off. I don't feel like I expressed myself well (I argue better in person than over the phone) and instead of getting his insights on the show, which I was really looking forward to, I mostly just felt invalidated. How do you deal with this kind of thing when you encounter it? When you have loved ones who say hurtful things by accident, how do you set it aside and not let it ruin your day?",

		"text": "I'll attempt to shorten this story.I have pretty crappy insurance. I got it because of my very low income and there's no monthly copay. It's generally used at one office with a specific name that has multiple locations.My PCP told me to get my eyes checked out since I had never had a routine eye exam. So I called to make an appointment. I asked if my insurance covered it, since that insurance covers that doctor's office. They said no for some reason but to get there 40 minutes early and they would consult with me to see if I would qualify for the sliding scale. (They had an opening two days later which I grabbed because it's hard to get appointments there.) I had to bring proof of income, proof of address and ID. The last two were no problem but I realized I had sent all my proof of income back to my mom in the state I moved from last year, halfway across the U.S. She doesn't have access to a scanner and doesn't know how to use one anyway, so she ran home from work during her lunch break even though she had other stuff she had to do, found my info, ran to the post office and sent it overnight for $20. I had no idea it cost that much.Anyway, my mom tells me she sent it and then I get a call saying oh I actually can use my insurance and don't need to get there early or show proof of income. Ughhhh! So I went the next day and brought the proof of income and address with me just in case even though I knew I wouldn't need them.I had to get up early and it was a 21 mile drive there each way since that's the office they told me I had to be seen at. I get there and the secretary says oh your insurance expired (no it didn't) and you're not supposed to be seen here. You're supposed to be seen in your town and it's free. (No one told me either of those things.) Here you can't be seen unless you have proof of insurance and address and then it's a $25 copay. What?!?!?!?! So I said fine, luckily I had that stuff and wanted to get it over with after the inconvenience so I told her to go ahead. I was approved and magically my insurance was deemed valid. I told the secretary how annoyed I was at the situation and asked who to call. She gave me a card and told me who to ask for and that this type of situation happens all the time. So then why is no one fixing it?!So I immediately called the woman she told me to and left a message. This was on Thursday and it hasn't been long but I haven't heard back yet. I have a feeling I won't. If it was a big insurance company then I would threaten them with writing bad reviews, but whereas this is an insurance company for low-income people who have no other choice basically, I don't know if that would do anything.So, to summarize, a bunch of people told me conflicting information, my mom was inconvenienced, I owe her $20 for the overnight charge, I spent about $8 in gas on a 42-mile round trip journey, it inconvenienced me by getting up early and spending the time traveling there, and I had to pay a $25 copay that I shouldn't have had to pay. So we're up to a grand total of $45 plus about $8 in gas so about $53 plus my mom's and my time inconvenienced. And I don't have a lot of money. That is ridiculous for a discount insurance eye doctor's appointment.I'm livid and don't know what I should do or if there is anything I can do but if this happens again I'll lose my mind.Any advice? Sorry this was so long. I attempted to keep it short. Thank you!",

It’s not only when my supervisor or person of authority does it. It’s anytime anybody does it.   We’re allowed to listen to headphones while we work. Still, whenever someone walks up and I’m listening to something I again get startled and quickly try to pull my headphones off and hide them.    I’ve been thinking about how when I was a kid if I got thirsty in the middle of the night I would quietly tip toe into the kitchen, trying with all my might to not make a single noise. I would turn on the faucet very lightly and drink straight from it. I was worried my footsteps or the cup or the cupboard door or the running water would make too much noise.    I guess I’ve been conditioned to expect that there are no patterns or rational thought. Anybody can and will get mad at you for anything you do, without warning or justification. They won’t get mad at you every time for everything. But remember that thing you did yesterday that didn’t bother anyone? Maybe someone even laughed or reacted to it positively?

It seems to me that a Stargate is the perfect defensive structure.First, you have a small corridor. All of your fire can be focused onto it. Should the defensive fortifications be set up on the flanks of the gate, a crossfire could be achieved with minimal risk of being hit from errant staff blasts/bullets/etc.Secondly, the defensive positions would have the advantage of being able to fire onto attackers before they have fully exited the event horizon. The enemy cannot see you from the other side so they can only fire blindly before stepping through the gate. Attackers should be killed before they even have a conscious chance to turn, aim and hit the defenses.Thirdly, defenses should, in general, maintain a rate of fire that allows one group to reload while another group fires, keeping a constant stream of bullets/staff blasts from going towards the gate.Yeah, this is just me nit-picking after so many watches, but just something I wanted to bring up.",

Do you find yourself spending the majority of your time on things you didn't intend to do at all? I was like this for many years, and only got better at it after learning about mindfulness meditation, acceptance and commitment therapy and positive psychology. Putting together what I learned, I formulated this simple process I now use to do anything. ## Five simple steps to do anything1. **Set your intentions straight**. What is it exactly that you're trying to do? Why are you doing it? How will you know when you are done?2. **Put together a simple plan**. Divide your task into smaller, actionable steps. Decide when you are going to start. Block some time. Gather the necessary tools. Visualize yourself taking the steps despite all the negative thoughts and emotions that are likely to arise. 3. **Begin** to act according to your intentions. Give what you are doing your full attention.4. **When you feel the urge to stop and do something else instead, don't**. Instead, pause for a few deep, natural breaths. Name the urge and notice where in your body it feels the strongest. Breathe right into it. Give it some space. Leave it where it is. Notice how you can feel the urge and still continue.5. **When you are done, enjoy your sense of achievement fully**. Allow your success to sink right into you like the warmth from a hot bath. Let it make  you stronger and more capable. Take in this accomplishment, no matter how small, and use it to fuel more mindful work.Check the comments for an example and answers to common questions.

Watched some YouTube videos on diagnosing the drive, so I pulled it out and opened it up and the heads were indeed about 65% of the way in toward the middle from the edge. I very carefully tried to spin the platter and simultaneously free the heads, and I got them to release out to the edge of the platter, but it still won't spin freely. Plugged it back in and it started making a rhythmic beeping sound now instead of clicking. I'm pissed as I lost about 250 movies and all my pictures, but it is what it is.

Almost a year ago to date my brother came to live my wife and I (we were then engaged). Both our families are from a pretty economically depressed area of the country (USA), there isn't much in the way of work, good work at least. So my wife and I thought it'd be a nice gesture to invite my brother to live with us for a few months, long enough for him to get a good job, save up some money, and move out on his own. We made sure he understood that we had reasonable expectations of him prior to allowing him to live with us.It took him 3 months to find a job. Not because they're far and few between, but because his resume lacks continuity. He works shit jobs (retail and sales mostly) for a few weeks/months until he is fired or quits. Then he has long periods of unemployment, basically he won't find another job until his bank account runs dry. I explained to him that he needs to find a job with a high turnover rate (because they're always hiring) and where it's pretty difficult to get fired unless you don't show up, and work it for a year. A good job will not hire you if they think you'll just up and leave or not put forth your best effort, they want to see dedication/commitment. I suggested restaurants, he and I worked in one together when we were both in college (he dropped out, refuses to follow the foreign language requirement, says he's incapable of learning another language), I worked in them for many years while in school until I got that one good job that opened up doors for me.In the almost exactly 1 year he's been here, he's worked only 9 months. In those 9 months, he's worked 5 jobs. He's been fired from some, some he quit without having another job lined up. My wife and I have explained to him that you don't quit a job unless you have another job waiting for you. But he always gives us excuses. Really what he wants is to lock himself in his room, drink beer, and play video games. He saves up enough money to do this for a few weeks and then looks for work as his bank account empties.Last week he told his boss that in month he would submit his 2 weeks notice. So they fired him on the spot. He didn't even have another job lined up. He told my wife and I that he didn't think they'd fire him and that he was going to spend that month looking for another job. He essentially gave them 6 weeks notice in a job where he lacked any value to the company.My wife and I told him he had until Friday (7/7) to find another job or he was gone. Well, he decided to get loaded last night and when I asked him how the job hunt was going he tried to make it seem like I gave him an impossible task. I explained to him that restaurants will give you a job the same day. I even know of an Applebee's 1 mile from where we live that would hire him today (used to work there, know the manager, spoke with him) and he wouldn't do it. After a lot of yelling and him blaming my wife and I for sabotaging his future, I threw him out. He's leaving on Friday and I couldn't be more thrilled. I love my brother, I really do. I really, really, really wanted to help him. But I can't give him any more chances. I can't help someone who won't help themselves. I'm so excited to shit with the door open, walk around naked, and have sex anywhere I want. I'm excited to have my guest room back, to have his shit out of our apartment, and to have my life back to normal. He did this to himself. ",

Therefore, I had assumed that they might be open to the idea of me getting all the clothes I want (thus shutting me up) without to large financial burden. Everyone I know who thrifts loves it. Plus, my cousins had recently mentioned to my mom and I a good experience shopping at Goodwill, so I asked my mom to take me. To my surprise, she said no, citing the fact that \"we don't shop there\" as the reason why. She didn't really get any more specific, and she seemed like she didn't want to argue so I just kinda shut up; I asked her again a few weeks later and she said the same thing. This post is getting long so I'm just going to wrap things up right now. My question here is how do I convince her to let me go thrifting? Going by myself isn't really an option, and I don't have any good friends or older siblings, etc who could take me. Any advice would be thoroughly appreciated :)",

Between that set and the jenky, multiplayer decks my friends (who had been playing for 4-8 years previous) built, I've always had a fascination with counters. I have a handful of decks that use them, but the one thing I've never been able to do in EDH is build my dream artifact counter manipulation deck. The nature of EDH makes this a little difficult- there are a handful of very good cards that use counters and a handful of manipulation cards. It's hard to consistently have a hand with things to do in a deck with ~62 unique nonland cards. So I come for you to help.I want to build a deck that manipulates counters (and untap shenanigans) and has an artifact theme.Narrowing it down to colors I know I want blue. Red has some good artifact friendly cards, so I think it's desired. But I haven't been able to narrow it much more than that.Black has a few good, relevant cards including Tezzerret, Agent of Bolas, and Bolas himself. Green has tons of cards to manipulate counters, though it's not a great color for artifacts. And white, while it has a history of working well with artifacts and has some cards that would be good to manipulate (Luminarch Ascension comes to mind), I haven't seen a strong argument for it yet.These colors put me in a weird spot for generals. I've yet to find a good one. So I would love to hear recommendations.What I would like to do here and now are narrow down the colors, pick a good general, and list a few must-have cards for the deck. Throughout the week (or later as time permits- vacation starts on Saturday!) we can work together to make this deck or I'll build it and share it when it's done.[This is where I'll be listing the cards I've picked. I put together something but it's not working, so I'll copy the cards I know I want over](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/12-10-14-tick-tock)Edit: I should have been more specific with what exactly I'm looking for. The kind of stuff I'm thinking of is proliferating Titan Forge, or comboing out with Myr Welder, Soliton, Titan Forge, and Khalni Gem, or exiling Mindslaver under Prototype Portal. Just jenky artifact things.",

Alt+Tab to your Evernote notebook, [plan.txt](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/11/plantxt-the-most-effective-productivity-tool-that-youve-never-heard-of/) or other work diary, which should be always open in the background, put 10 minutes on a timer app and type away without stopping, until the timer rings. Don't touch the backspace key, don't pause to correct your grammar, be as clear as you can, but above all keep your fingers moving.There's just something about forcing your thinking into written form that makes it clearer, less distracting and more manageable. Typing furiously under a time limit makes you feel you are already gaining momentum. Also, writing quickly helps you bypass your inner critic and cut through the bullshit. Writer and writing coach Natalie Goldberg's concept of [writing practice](https://whisperdownthewritealley.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/natalie-goldbergs-rules-for-writing-practice/) is the method I picked this up from.I've taught this idea to dozens of students, and once they've tried it a few times and seen how it's okay to use writing for *thinking* and not just *communicating*, almost all of them have found it useful. It's something you can always fall back on.### Here are some additional tips* While you can write pure stream of consciousness narrative of your thoughts and gain [distance](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/4o7g79/method_did_you_like_the_quit_any_habit_post_here/) that way, I find it helpful to have a bit more structure in the form of a few simple prompts I can use depending on my current needs: \"Yesterday I...\", \"Right now I'm experiencing...\", \"I'm afraid...\", \"I know...\", \"I don't know...\", \"What would make feel accomplished today is...\", \"I'm grateful for...\", \"What I am really trying to say in this essay is...\", \"What's stopping me right now is...\" and so on.  If I can't think of anything else to write, and get tired of repeating the same sentence over and over again, I just start a new paragraph with the same prompt.* Do you need to save these entries like a traditional journal? Not necessarily. While it can be fun to go back and look at a snapshot of your thinking later on, the magic happens in *the act of writing*. And in any case, journals are not very good for storing information you need to reference later. For example, if I need to clear my head before my GTD style weekly review, I might just do a brain dump of all the things that occupy space in my mind, in one long list, and put any tasks that come up on my task list where they belong.* You can use timed writing to kickstart any writing assignment or project and produce raw material for you to edit later. In fact, one of the best books on writing, Elbow's *Writing Without Teachers* is based on this idea of \"first making a mess, then cleaning it up\". It's a liberating approach to writing.  Knowing that you can easily produce 500 words on any topic essentially eliminates blank page syndrome.",

If I revert my version of windows, everything starts working again. It only breaks when I am forced to update to the new version.I have already checked to make sure I am not in tablet mode. I have check to see that desktop icons are on. I have restarted the computer.Any and all suggestions are welcome. My current version of windows is 1803, updated today.Thanks!",

Because I haven't really tested it or seen the commander played at all I'm just not sure where the weak points are, and any recommendations are appreciated.I went with a (practically) creatureless build because it synergizes too well. It gives me more chances to benefit from her ability, it changes the text on Proteus Staff to say \"Fuck target Spell Crumple,\" and because it offered a unique deck-building experience that I haven't even taken advantage of with Jeleva.I tried putting as many creature-token generators as possible along with some protection, removal, and multiple combat step abilities. I've tried adding some haste enablers but it's difficult with one real creature. The other thing I did was add an artifact subtheme. This is probably where the deck will go wrong, but I've been wanting to play around with untapping artifacts and messing with proliferate for a long time as Scars was my first full block. The reason I chose Narset is because if my artifacts are free I can focus all my mana on activating them. The theme seems weak at best as I've had to make cuts to make room for Narset staples, but I really want some other opinions.http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/just-narset-things/Edit: an issue I keep running into in goldfishing is a t4 or t5 Planeswalkers with no protection, which is a feel-bad situation.",

Tension and distrust between men and women exists because of it, and both sexes could be described as exploiting each other in different ways through it.Any time one sex appears to have an advantage over the other, they have a unique disadvantage to go along with it, and much of it stems from the simple evolutionary reality that men are opportunistic breeders and women are selective gatekeepers. Women have the power to entice and to choose, but live in fear of rape and emotional abuse. Every time they encounter a man they have to be suspicious and feel they must guard against all advances. Meanwhile, men are mostly free from that fear, but they have to do dramatically more to ever attract anyone; it is always an uphill battle against rejection and isolation, and even when they find someone they may have to worry about only being valued for their money.Art and pop culture are a shrine to how unhappy romantic relationships make people. Nobody seems to know what is best for their own happiness when it comes to choosing a mate or maintaining relations with them.Maybe this has always been, or maybe our current culture has made things worse by eschewing social constraints that made the relations between the sexes more civil. But one thing is for certain: the day humans can reproduce asexually will a great day indeed.   ",

Over the past year or so, I've become quite a homebody, and while I mostly have no issue with this, I recently found myself sometimes wishing I had the companionship of a partner. So a few weeks ago I started using a dating website, mostly out of curiosity and a desire to do something different and see what happens. I went on a date, and it went well. And that's when the anxiety started creeping in. I know one date does not mean a relationship is beginning, but nevertheless...I know relationships are a two way street, and I don't think it's reasonable for me to expect that the person I'm dating be as much of an introvert as I am, but I think that's the idea I had in mind when I considered dating. I like staying home, and when I do socialize, it's nearly always one-on-one, and I'm home early. I'm in my 30s and don't want kids, so there's no time crunch, but I do get those lovely comments from well-intentioned relatives. I've dated casually a lot in the past, but haven't had a real long-term relationship in many years. Usually relationships just feel like too much compromise (i.e. my routine is disrupted too much) for it to be worth it to me. Any of my fellow introverts have any advice or perspective on this? I don't want to string someone along if, deep down, I just wish I had someone to go hiking and binge watch tv with. The idea of having to meet someone's friends and/or family, attend their social events, or do other things of this nature is what makes me not want to pursue a relationship at all. But on the other hand, I feel like I'm potentially depriving myself of the joy of a deep relationship, so I don't know. I feel very lost.Thanks for reading. 😊",

Thankfully though, a lot of it can be removed and hidden. Also, other thing I liked a lot about Moto G that ZF doesn't have is the gripshell cases, but it looks like ZF2 might be getting that later, but they don't look nearly as minimalistic or well designed as the Moto ones.

While it has been finished for some time, Kansaska was never given a date they should have launched it and as such we have waited until now to launch it. Along with the German Satellite, Aswani scientists have came along with cameras that will be launched and recovered in the same manner as the Hawaiian rocket launch. These cameras were brought by 10 Aswani scientists and 5 engineers who will be there to give the cameras and watch the launch. This rocket also has a Nene Goose supplied by Hawaii sedated and tied up in the upper section of the rocket, we are unsure why they requested we send it, but because of our close partnership we have decided to go along with it. The only other feature that is different from previous Aether Rockets is the fact that this rocket is sporting a Prussian flag engraved into the side from a request when their king died. This rocket was launched July 4th, ACE 25 and we have recovered the Photos and our small radio tower tells us a successful deployment of the satellite, The Goose probably died of heat from the launch and remains will burn up upon reentry of the Aether III. This was a simple launch and from our past two we feel we have mastered V-2 launches along with production, while resources we lack at some time, given enough we assume a V-2 a month can be done if provided readily and with our new deal with China we expect a V-2 a month to become a reality.This was not the only launch in Kansaska. The Kansaskan PGM-11 (No name given yet, we will give this redstone family rocket a  name on our real mission) a PGM-11 style rocket is considered a direct descendant of the V-2 and from that the creation was not all that a change from our current productions, the only real change was the enlargement of the body along with improving the engine. The real task at hand was creating a cockpit that would survive the launch and as such this first launch is a test to see if this can survive reentry.  On August 25th ACE 25 the first Kansaskan PGM-11 launched, the cockpit contained simple pressure gauges that will pop if too much is given. we bought a [dog that we named Laika JR](http://images.natureworldnews.com/data/images/full/8572/laika.jpg) to be a test subject in our module attempt. We do not plan to be cruel like the Russians and have prepared the capsule so it will have survivable albeit uncomfortable environment. With simple programs on the Air Calculator, mainly a trigger to deploy parachute and de-orbit. The rocket blasts off right one schedule August 25th ACE 25. With the Command module flying higher and higher the rocket eventually becomes a spec and after that the human eye can not even see it. Given the angle our ship was given an orbit that will slowly destabilize. While our radios pick up signal slowly we from the frequency have concluded that it has approached time to de-orbit. Laika JR became the first animal in space along with the first animal to orbit. Upon giving the signal and with a bit of guesswork the orbit ended with the remainder of the rocket blasting it back to earth.  While in the air the Air Computers built by Yucatan signaled the Parachute also made by Yucatan to unfurl and slow the descend. Given the radio signal we expected splash down to be around the Atlantic and on August 26th ACE 25, a boat found and recovered the capsule. Upon opening we found a startling sight. Laika JR was alive and well. Our gauges survived the dog was eating from the food we left and the Air Tank held enough. Laika JR has been adopted by the research team and will partial be studied for affect from space flight. The Capsule looked completely reusable, with repair needed to the heat resistant plating. This is a great advancement for Kansaska and the world---Really the only major event is the PGM-11 the Aether III is minor one and more a request fulfilled  ",

		"text": "Since I'm a general-purpose nerd who's into all kinds of stuff with a \"canon\", such as Star Wars, the Tolkien universe, and others, I'm familiar with how these canons work. You have canon stories and non-canon stories, etc. One thing that seems to be totally unique to Star Trek, though, is canon faces. This is never official, and I think the JJTrek may have finally brought an end to it.What I mean is this - most of the characters have only been played by one actor in their time. So Picard, for example, looks exactly like Patrick Stewart. Stewart doesn't just play Picard. He *is* Picard. I think this is largely because the show is primarily a TV thing, as opposed to primarily books or movies.I think in a lot of other canon universes, when a new actress was brought into place the doctor in season 2 TNG, you would have had her be the same character, just a different actress. And we all would just shrug our shoulders and figure that's what Crusher looks like now. But not Star Trek... everybody has to look the same. Even down to Colonel Worf being played by Michael Dorn in The Undiscovered Country.Where I really notice it is in fan art. In all sci fi or fantasy worlds, you get fan art like \"This is my painting of Gandalf / Darth Maul / etc.\" and they are rarely a portrait of the actor, but of how the character is imagined. But in Star Trek, not basing it on the actor would be almost sacrilege. I mean, if I painted a bald guy in a red shirt with 4 pips looking brilliant but stern on the bridge of a Galaxy class star ship, but say he looked a little more French than Sir Patrick, nobody would recognize it as Picard.This is one of the things I love about the prequel series is we actually have some new faces around now. So now there is this new interpretation of each of the characters. I think this makes them more powerful as ideas, as it allows the \"true Kirk\" or \"true Chekov\" to somehow rise into the world of Platonic forms.What do you think - am I imagining this distinction? Or is it maybe a good thing?",

Should I try to make it stand less? Also, it would look better if I wrote just the University and left out the Coursera part, but would it be misleading?- Should I mention my Erasmus year?

I don't know my RMs.I've been working out for some years now, and in that time my arms have become huge, my back has broadened, my legs have thickened... everything has grown but my chest. It doesn't look entirely flat, but my pecs have grown much much less than any other muscle.I currently do, in my chest day, 3x12 normal bench press with 14 kg (plus the bar) 3x10 inclined press  (plus the bar) with 10 kg and 3x8 chest dips with bodyweight. I usually do two or three 20 push-up series to finish.I also eat and sleep well enough, as is evidenced by the gains in the rest of my body.What am I doing wrong? I made a point of improving my bench press form a few months ago, because my elbows hurt after it. Could my form still be wrong in such a way that it doesn't hurt me but I still can't reap all the benefits from benching?EDIT: In case someone has a similar problem the recommendations I've got here are (thank you all very much):- Add bench flies, preferably with cable, but dumbbell also works.- Lift heavier, either increasing reps, weight or both.- Improve bench form. I think mine is OK, but I guess I could retract even more the scapula, which seems to be more important than I though. [This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ5iCcKzg2Q) was recommended.- Try to improve the mind-muscle connection, meaning try to \"feel\" your chest contracting when you press.- Maybe the chest is growing but have too much fat (pecs are easily hidden by fat) or you lats are making it seem smaller than it is.- Slow down the tempo.- It maybe be your genetics.",

		"text": "I know, huge question. I've been doing A LOT of thinking over the past few years and I'll come to a 100% definite conclusion, and then I'll switch back to the other extreme and then fall in the middle somewhere. It's making me crazy. I can't wait forever though. I'm 32 and have to eventually make a decision. Any of you ever been in the same boat? Advice is appreciated. Thanks.I have wanted to be a mom from a very young age... I don't remember exactly when, but sometime around kindergarten maybe. I've always loved kids and been very good at taking care of them/teaching them ever since I was a kid myself. I've spent so much of my life knowing I was going to be a mom and thinking of names and even how I'm going to raise them (i.e. how I feel about allowance and stuff like that.) It feels weird to just know that my lineage will stop with me if I don't have kids. Will anyone remember me when I'm dead? Who will take care of me when I'm old? Also, my parents both want to be grandparents. (They're not pressuring me though and want me to do what's right for me, so that's not a major part of my decision.) Also, it would be so cool for me to raise a child/children and watch them hit milestones, develop as a person and find their personality/interests, and teach them to become a good person.However, it frightens me to have kids for many reasons also. I don't have a significant other, which I'm also on the fence about. I would love to have someone to be there for who is also there for me, but I have always had trust issues plus dating makes me extremely nervous. Yes, it's 2017 and I could have kids without having a significant other. However, I'm not sure if that's fair to the child to not have a father, and also raising a child is hard. I'm really not sure that I could do it by myself. That also relates to the fact that if I was a single parent, I of course would have to rely on myself to work and make money and couldn't take time off to be with the baby while relying on my SO to work. It would be extremely hard for me to put a newborn in daycare and go to work all day, then pick up the baby and take care of them at night, rinse and repeat. I don't think I have that kind of strength. Plus, my job is pretty demanding and I often have to do work at night.I've been depressed lately and have had trouble just taking care of myself and my cat. However, maybe I wouldn't be depressed if I had a child that I've always wanted. Then again, that's risky because what if I remained depressed even after having the child? I'm also afraid of passing depression/anxiety on to the child since it runs in my family.Pregnancy and especially childbirth scare the shit out of me. I don't know if I could get through it.... all the pain.So, let's say I adopted a kid. That takes a ton of money and time and I don't know if I would have the time/money to do that.Let's say in an ideal world I have the perfect husband, perfect pregnancy and birth, and perfect child. I would still have things I'd worry about. If this was 1985, or even 1995, my list of worries wouldn't be the same. However, the way the world is recently does scare me. Yes, I know crime has actually gone DOWN since the 80s and 90s, but it's not just that.School shootings are a big one. Yes, statistically they don't happen much and schools are more prepared for them, but the fact they happen as frequently as they do is terrifying to me. I mean, forget about me-- how terrifying would that be to a kid? Young kids have to prepare for lockdown drills now and they know what that means. That just makes me so sad that it's come to that, and I can't see that being good for their development. Yes, I realize it's necessary to prepare them, but it just saddens me that they're not as innocent as they should be and they're exposed to such things unlike a couple decades ago.School is way more academic than it used to be. I realize this probably sounds absurd, on a list of what scares me about having kids, but it's something I feel strongly about. Kindergarten used to be a half day AND it usually involved rest time, a couple recesses, free play time, etc. Now kindergarten is a full day and way too academic for my liking. There's rarely rest time or free play time. There's less recess. At the age of 5, kids are being tested and having way too much academics thrown at them, which I'm afraid will lead to stressing them out/making them feel stupid. Then, when they're just a little older, they now have to take very difficult state tests at the age of 8 or 9. School then just becomes about preparing for the test. It's nerve-wracking and tedious. If they don't pass these tests, they might have to repeat that grade. Again, it's different from a couple decades ago because then you just tried your best on the test and if you didn't do well, you didn't have to repeat the grade. Also, a couple decades ago the teachers generally didn't have to spend months teaching to the test. So clearly all that is something I don't want to put a kid through.The Internet is a scary place with cyber bullying and having the kid's picture being accessible on social media. Again, not a problem a couple decades ago.I can't watch the news often because of how anxious it makes me, but apparently the world is going to shit because we're running out of natural resources, toys and food contain hazardous substances, etc. Is that the kind of world I want to introduce to a child?Oh, another thing that's changed in recent years is that kids apparently aren't allowed to be unsupervised without fear of the police being called. I would be anxious to allow my 11-year-old to walk to a neighbor's house without having the police called on me, and that's just absurd that it even happens. Kids need to learn to be independent and they can't do that if CPS gets called every time an older kid is unsupervised.Anyway, this was way longer than I anticipated, but I hope it answers the questions. I'm also afraid though that if I decide not to have a child, I'll regret it.Let me know if you have any questions. Please remember what I wrote are my opinions, and we're all entitled to our own, so I don't want to start any fights. If you have differing opinions, that's fine, but this post is about how I feel.

		"text": "I got a 6S two weeks ago after my 1.5-year-old 5C started to exhibit some problems. I didn't think it was worth it to get a refurbished phone, or to go through the extra steps to get it fixed via third-party, so I just up and bought a 6S.Now I've read a fair bit online of people talking about how their battery lives aren't great compared to older models, or how they really need a spare battery to get through the day. Some of them didn't say what they were doing with their phones, while others had specific use cases. One thing I realized with the 6S is that it's not so much about how long the battery lasts, but it really comes down to how productive you are with your phone. I'd leave my apartment at 7:30 in the morning with a full charge, and by the time I get home, the battery is somewhere between 10 and 20 percent. I admit that I was hoping for a longer charge, but I also realized that I was doing much more with my 6S than I was with my 5C. With my 5C, I read the news on NYTimes and the Economist, browsed Reddit, went through websurfing in Safari and texted my SO via iMessage. With my 6S, I am doing all that, plus reading even more news because the additional space helps make reading more pleasant and I can move only so much in a tightly packed rush-hour subway so taking out my iPad or a physical newspaper is just not feasible. I'm also using Siri more often to make reminders or look up word definitions. There is longer screen time because Touch ID makes me jump into the home screen much quicker than when I was typing in my passphrase to unlock my 5C. Compared to when I was using my 5C, I'm more productive and more unproductive. So to sum it up, I feel it's not so much that the battery sucks, it's that we as users are doing more with the newer phones. One comment I read a while ago about the Apple battery case finally made sense: if your use case requires it, get it. If it doesn't don't bother. For now, I'm good without it, but maybe down the line, I'll consider it. ",

If he's not really her great-grandson, then he's just some guy who is in the care of the same woman who takes care of the Stark children. Quite a noble circumstance for \"just a stableboy\".I think Ned brought him back from the war after learning about him from a Tully and convinced old Nan this was her great-grandson because he didn't want to tell her that her true descendants had died - that would be too much to bear. Old Nan doesn't truly believe him, but accepts Hodor anyway because she wants to believe and she feels compassion for Hodor.At some point in the future, when the Frey's have all been slaughtered for their treachery, the secret of Hodor will be revealed and he will sit as Lord of the Twins, bannerman to the Tullys. The secret will be discovered by Bran, through a vision from a heart tree where he overhears Ned discussing the plan with somebody in a godswood. This will cause Bran to send Hodor back to the Twins from the North (where he isn't much help to our little broken greenseer), along with a letter to the Tullys telling them the truth.",

This means that sooner or later, I will have to consider learning how to use CAT software, and I have learned that Trados is the (de facto?) industry standard. It is only available for Windows as well. Which leads to my dilemma: should I rather opt for a Windows laptop instead? I am more or less firmly in the Apple ecosystem, using Apple gear, and this gives me the most optimal productivity for my current translation and studies needs. Can I get away with using virtualization software like Parallels with Trados? Or is a native Windows environment a must?Edit: a search for system requirements for Trados says:&gt; For optimum performance, we recommend 4 GB RAM and a recent Intel or compatible CPU.In the Intel lineup, there is the Core i3/5/7 for desktops and bigger laptops, and the m-series ultra low voltage lineup.

Firstly I remember the days of good old Civ V when you could pick the size, Duel, Tiny, Small, Standard, Large and Huge. The Huge Map was terrific, also great if you spawned in North America. Now, with Civ VI (which I love by the way), there's a one size fits all earth map, which is definitely not as big as the Huge Earth Map. It's probably like a Standard but many islands are much bigger. Plus, you can only use 8 civs, unlike the 22 you could fit in Civ 5. However the true star location of civ 6 is very nice. Islands like Britain and Ireland appear very disproportionately large (which is good), whereas peninsulas like Arabia and Fenno-Scandinavia appear too small. This map is like a reverse-Mercator projection sometimes. Also, there are new geographical differences besides all the new natural wonders, you now can't access the North coast of Norway and therefore Archangel, you now can't build more than one canal cities in central America. However, we can access Hudson Bay in Canada and the Darién Gap in South America (which is all unrealistic?). The USA feels too cramped (even with Alaska) as the great lakes suck with 3 tiles and no Old Faithful, Great Mesa, and the Barringer Crater. In Asia, Japan has no mountains or MOUNT FUJI, and Indonesia feels incomplete without the volcano Krakatoa. Down south Australia is boring in Civ Vi with no mountains (they could have used Uluru), and not enough rainforest tiles. Also, where's Hawaii. Okay, so in some ways the New Earth Map is a better balance in terms of Luxuries (debatable) and new wonders in AFRICA. But we need big Earth Maps again! I wanted to get this off my chest (it's an unpopular opinion) so please don't kill me. Thank you",

		"text": "Hello and welcome to this post in which I will hypothesize things about The Bachelor since it's the offseason and shitposting is at an all time high.Every year, on the Bachelor application, the girls are always asked \"If you could be one animal, which animal would you be and why?\" This question is probably the most thought-provoking question on the application, because it reveals so much about the mindset of the contestant: are they fierce, are they playful, do they like adventure, can they breathe through a hole in their heads?So last year, much was made of Nick's women picking \"dolphin\" as the answer to this question.  So I decided to go back and figure out exactly how many women gave \"dolphin\" as their answer.  I learned many things.  I learned that some of these women were actually on the show.  I learned that we had an Alaskan kicker who didn't make it out of night one (a travesty for all involved).  I learned that Michelle the food truck owner thinks that Albus Dumbledore is a real person.  And I also learned that they don't ask the animal question to everyone.  Turns out they only ask this question to like half the cast.  [In this case 17 women had the opportunity to let us gaze into their soul.](https://i.imgur.com/5Nph33G.png)  However, only 5 of them said \"dolphin\": Alexis (duh), Astrid, Angela, Briana, and Lauren.  That means 16% of the cast would be a dolphin.  Of those asked the question, only 29% answered this way.  That's not even 1/3rd of the asked group!  Honestly, if you wanted a more statistically viable number, you should have gone with a big cat (lion or tiger), as 6 of the women asked answered that way, which makes 35% of the sampled group, a far larger number than 29% which means it's more relevant.Also, it is striking just how accurate this question was to reveal the personalities of the girls.  Alexis and Astrid definitely fall under the \"fun-loving\" group (I honestly can't say anything about the other three because I don't know who they are), so dolphin describes them perfectly.  Danielle M answered \"pegasus because I want to have awesome hair\" and while she might not match up to Caila's mane, she definitely was a mythical creature on the show, being one of the only people to leave to do something worthwhile with their time.  DLo chose fox, which might indicate that her innocent behavior masks a cunning side we have not previously seen from her.  Christen chose \"wild mustang\" which might be a dud but I dunno, it's early and trying to come up with justifications for all of these is hard.But here's another thing I gleaned from looking at this data that I collected: nobody who had a meaningful arc on the show (i.e. made it very far) was asked this question.  Vanessa was not asked this question, nor was Raven (the runner-up).  Rachel was not asked about which animal she would be, nor was Kristina.  Corinne was, but I think most people watching the show saw that Nick was not taking her seriously as a contestant.  So with that thoroughly empirical evidence, we can see that even though this question is the most thought-provoking and revealing, if you see it asked, you can pretty much rule them out of having a serious development on the show.  Which makes sense, because you know who they are already, you don't need to go any further.Which brings me to Arie's girls.  We know that most of these women will fancy themselves as strong, fierce, independent women coming on to the show looking for love, so I definitely expect to see our fair share of lions and tigers here.  But dolphin was kind of a dark horse as far as animals go.  Nobody expected it to come out of the woodwork like it did.  So the question I have to answer here is: what animal will surpass dolphin as the Most Likely Animal For Bachelorettes?Let's look at the facts.  Arie was a race car driver, so you have to assume that a bunch of women will put some super fast animal to appeal to his need for speed 2: underground.  But Arie is also a real estate salesman, so you will probably want to appeal to his sense of family and building a home.  Plus, you need the animal to be cute, preferably fluffy.  Because nobody says they want to be a naked mole rat (sorry Rufus).  So based purely off of all of my prodigious intellect, I predict the Most Likely Animal for Bachelorettes to be: **bunny**.  They're cute, fluffy, they build nests where they all pack in and cuddle, and they're really fucking fast (until they get fat).  So there you have it folks, a completely factual analysis of why \"what animal you would be\" is objectively the best question, and also the best way to predict who will be eliminated.  Tune in next time, where talk about why people who answered \"what fruit or vegetable would you be\" are terrible people and should be fired for answering such a dumbass question.",

Now, what I am confused about is does this mean internships for industry will also be included or not. I am interested in applying to some internships for accounting roles in Dell, HEB (grocery chain in texas), HP and a few other companies. I know that they have applications on their websites so does that mean that they will not include them on the career board?Also I plan on applying to a mix of internships like industry and public and just choosing out of the ones I get call backs for. Is this wide net approach applying to internships effective or should I just pick a few and go from there?Also, sorry if this is a dumb question, if I apply to a summer internship for 2019 in public say in the fall of 2018 would I be hearing back from the firm pretty soon or how does the entire process look?Thanks for any advice! I can't believe I'll be at the point in my college career where I can actually apply for accounting internships!",

My brain is the creepy lecherous monster that feminism has warned the world about. Yes, this is a problem with a uniquely male component. I experience an involuntary attraction to almost 100% of the women I see, even though I want nothing to do with them; my brain is an opportunistic objectifier. Hence the constant guilt. If I ever stopped being guilty, I would become the archetypal creep in the trench coat. Society has taught me that self-restraint is the only way to redeem yourself as a male. I keep hearing \"that's natural, that's just how the male brain is supposed to work.\" But a male can only be forgiven for being like this if he is attractive enough to get them to reciprocate.Being this way makes me feel tense around women. If they ever found out what I was thinking I doubt they would understand. They are suspicious of me, and they are right to be, and I wish they weren't. I wish we could really just be friends, because that is the most that we will ever be.There doesn't seem to be any way for me to become comfortable with my sexuality. I can only see downsides to not being asexual.",

I brought my car and we decided that it was a good idea to just sleep in my car until the morning to drive home. We both got inside and I left the keys in the cup holder. We were awoken by police officers and were required to take breathalyzer tests and were arrested for zero tolerance. I ended up getting my license suspended for that reason, but my friend got off scott free (besides having to pay the ordinance fees). My main question is if that is a valid reason to receive a license suspension. Honestly, I'd rather not go to court since all this has sucked me dry of money. I also have two more minor questions: How long would this stay in my record? I am trying to get a second job and rather them not see this.

Several months ago, I did the same thing. Went on a scratch ticket buying binge, honestly felt ***high*** on the rush that it gave me hopping from store to store buying tickets, hoping that I would win.The Internet, Information Retrieval, Gambling, Porn, Gaming, and many more all rooted in behavior. So long as it's behavioral and I enjoy it, I **will** get addicted to it. I'm fortunate enough that this never applied to drugs, but the loss of time still takes its toll. The goal now is just not to do a lot of damage to myself knowing that controlling my impulses is something that I will need to actively work on over a lengthy period of time.So, this is goodbye for now. To all of you seeking to overcome personal demons, I wish you the absolute best and hope you emerge as the success you know yourselves deep down inside to be.

I know that people do horrible things to each other and there are accounts of torture, rape, murder and war that are much more brutal but...goddamn. That's terrible. Her username is unimportant and those quotes are from a post many years ago. So I don't feel bad about showing them today. For some bizarre  reason I've been binge reading posts on the website survivinginfidelity.com. There's a lot of terrible stories on that website about horrible human beings who betray their kids and marriage, and equally heartbroken destroyed human beings that stayed with them. I thought that this person must be a troll, there's no way a human being could do that to their husband with his *\"best friend\"*. It's inconceivable. But they did, it really happened and the best (or worst?) part is that the husband was still trying to work it out. I'm not reading anymore posts on that site or about infidelity again if I can help it. ",

		"text": "***Notes***(skip this if you're not interested in how I wrote this)*I originally started writing this story a long time ago, when  I was 10-13, possibly after watching `Ghost`. I had written about one fifth of it, when I started noticing various plot holes, weird character behaviour and pacing, etc., which made me give upbecause it didn't make sense in my mind any more and trying to fix all of that was too frustrating. I've remembered it recently and decided to finish it, this time embracing all the absurd and non-sequitir stuff that frustrated me before. I don't think it's particularly good, but at least it's something I started at one point and eventually finished.*John Astor was running. He was running through the night streets of downtown. He knew that not agreeing to stay quiet about his employer's money laundering scheme wasn't a good idea, but he wasn't expecting a man with a gun who was following him. He needed to get out of his line of sight, and quick! A fire exit! John started climbing it, but as soon as he reached the roof of the building, he noticed that the gunner started climbing after him. With little choice, John ran to the side of the building where another one stood close enough to step over on top of it. With moonlight illuminating his way, he crossed several buildings that way, before turning his head to look back. His pursuer was nowhere to be seen. John smiled, but then realized that his feet had nothing below them. He was falling down. Light from the rising sun awoke John. He remembered falling down before blacking out but he didn't feel any pain even though he was lying on the pavement. He stood up and looked up to the roof of the building from which he had fallen, wondering how he'd survived, but then he noticed a body near him lying on the ground. It looked familiar. John looked closely. It was his body. It was the middle of the day. John was walking in the crowd but nobody noticed him. From time to time people would pass right through him. He was a ghost. Looking at the ground, he noticed that the pavement had switched to grass. He had reached city park. John tried to sit on a bench but fell through it. He couldn't touch anything. John tried to pick a rock on the ground. His hand went right through it. John kept trying to pick it up and thinking about what should he possibly do to be able to pick it put, when he suddenly noticed that the rock was in his hand, not falling through. He just had to think about it! Detective Jack Green was feeling frustrated. This week he had already received five reports from various eating establishments from around the city, all claiming the same thing: a piece of food would lift into the air from the shocked customer's plate and fly away through the door. He had personally interviewed eyewitnesses and checked the crime scenes for strings with hooks tied to them and ventilators – nothing, absolute zero. He had no idea what was happening. As he hit the gun lying on his table in frustration, his secretary entered the office. “Mr. Green, Mrs. Walters is here to see you.”“I'm busy.  And I don't know no Mrs. Walters. ”“She said, she can help your current investigation.”Detective looked up away from the desk.“OK, send her in. ”After a short while, an obese old woman in a hat and a bulky rain coat that covered her whole body entered the office. “So, Mrs. Walters-” the woman interrupted Green, tearing off the mask from her face and simultaneously dropping the raincoat, revealing that she actually was young and not fat. “Actually, it's Ms. Margareth Walters. I'm the head of Disguise department in the city's Scientific Research Institute. There's something I'd like to show you.”“In this room we have the Material Opacity Diminisher,” Walters gestured for Green to follow her into the room. The device resting on a pedestal in the center looked like a cross between a microscope and a projector. “This scientific mumbo-jumbo doesn't say anything to me, Ms. Walters. What does it do?”Walters placed a cloth rag on top of the device and pushed some buttons on it. The device started humming and the rag started gradually becoming transparent until it disappeared completely. “So, it can make stuff disappear?”“Not simply disappear, but become invisible,” Walters made a picking up motion where the rag was last seen and stretched her hand to Greene, letting him feel that the rag was still there. “Your criminal is using technology similar to this and I'm determined to make him stop.”John was starting to enjoy his new life. That was the second milkshake he got for free today. OK, now how about some beef stake? He went into the closest restaurant and started waiting. Finally, after an hour or so, a customer ordered what he wanted. He picked up the stake and in a relaxed manner headed to the exit, when suddenly he heard a sharp “NOW” and excruciating pain hit his whole body. He dropped the stake and ran to the door. He tried passing through it, but realized that he couldn't. The door felt solid, even though that wasn't his intention. He started hitting the door. “There he is! Get him!”, he heard voices behind his back. Then he felt a sharp blow to the head and blacked out. The pain from before permeating every inch of his body awoke John. He was in a white brightly lit room with padded walls. Behind the door he heard two voices, male and female arguing: “Don't play dumb with me, Walters, this is no joke!”“But he looks just like him! The guy who fell from the tenth floor!”“Stop this, or I'll-”Suddenly the pain jumped to a whole new level and John couldn't help but scream:“Stop!”The voices stopped. “Let me out!”“Are you John Astor?” the female voice asked him. “It hurts!”“We have to keep the machine turned on to keep you inside.”“Please make it stop!”“There was a brief pause.”“Do you promise to stay inside the cell if we turn it off?”“Listen Walters, If you think I'm going to just stand here, while you let this creep escape-”“Relax Green, we can turn it back on before he does. Well, do you promise?”“Yes!”There was an audible click and the pain started fading away. The door opened, letting inside a young woman. “I'm Margareth Walters. I want to ask you a few questions. First, is your name John Astor?”“Yes.”“John Astor was found dead two weeks ago. On the edge of-”“I know. I'm dead.”“Then why did you keep stealing food?”“What?”“Why would a ghost need food?”“What? I-I don't know.”“Why are you a ghost? This should be impossible.”“I don't know!”Margareth let out a deep sigh. “He's all yours, Detective Green.”With a stern look, detective slowly walked inside. “All-right bud, I don't care about all this scientific and spiritual mumbo-jumbo. All I know is that in front of me is a criminal, guilty of food theft. So, if you ever wish to see the light of day again, you better start talking.”“But I don't know anything!”“Enough! C'mon, throw me a bone, will ya?”John and Detective locked their eyes. The air felt electrolyzed, when suddenly Margareth broke the silence: “How did you die?”John blinked, “I... I was running... running away from my boss's men. That's it! My boss, Tommy Bertanelli, he's been laundering money and I caught him doing that. He killed me because I wouldn't stay quiet!”A hint of a smile appeared on detective's face: - Well Mr. Astor, it seems like we might just have a deal. Tommy Bertanelli let out a puff of cigar smoke: “What do you mean, 'we might have complications'?”The mafioso in front of him answered, trying to hide shaking in his voice: “It's our money laundering operation, Boss. Some people don't like participating in it, Boss. Boss, they might squeal.”“Well, let them know what happened to the last person who tried to do that, Bobby.”“Yes Boss, understood, Boss.”“Now get out of my sight.”“Okay, Boss.”As the mafioso closed door to his office, Tommy Bertanelli reclined in his chair, puffing his cigar. When he ordered John Astor killed, he thought that would be the last of puny people in this town to stand in his way. Evidently not. Never mind. People like that always can be squashed. And he had the means to squash. Suddenly, a burst of gunshots came from the door. Before, he could move, a bunch of cops burst in his office, led by a man in detective's trench-coat: “Detective Green from CTPD! You're under arrest Tommy Bertanelli, for money laundering and organized crime!”Bertanelli's cigar hit the floor as he sat with an open mouth while having his hand cuffed. “I'll see you in prison, Bertanelli,” Detective Green smirked through the police car's window as he closed its door. As the car drove away from the city pier, he turned around, facing John Astor and Margareth Walters. “Well you've done it kiddo. After we've put Bertanelli behind bars with that information you provided us, you free to go.”“Thanks. I think I needed this... I just didn't realize it.”“So, what now? Are you going to start performing at speakeasies?” Margareth spoke up.“No, I think I'm going to leave this city. To think. Thanks again. And goodbye,” John turned around, facing the city gulf and the sun setting above it. “What you're gonna do, rent a boat for ghost passage, kid?”“No, I'll just walk.”Detective and Margarteth watched as John swung his foot off the pier and firmly landed it onto the water, took a few unsure steps and went into a slow stride They watched until his silhouette disappeared into the sunset.

While my current internship is not User Experience related, this opportunity provides a foot-in-the-door to get into the program. This specific program requires a concentration or “speciality” and I’d like to make that focused on user experience. I was wondering, how could I go about making the most out of grad school in Human Factors to prepare myself for a highly profitable career in User Experience? After I graduate with a PhD, I’d like to work in the industry for about 30 years then go back to academia and mentor students following the similar path while providing my experiences in the industry. I have absolutely no knowledge about User Experience, so I’d like to hear the experience of others who also pursued a PhD in Human Factors. ",

There is much to learn and discover, even more to discuss. Nonetheless I`m not sure where I want to end up.

Basement is mostly fully finished except for a cement room where the mechanical stuff is, which is where he pointed that out.

If my last message was written in English right before I fired up Drafts on my Apple Watch, the dictation language would be in English, and vice versa. I just thought I would share this. tl;dr - Drafts dictation language on Apple Watch is set to the last-used language for typing something on the iPhone.**EDIT** - you CAN change the dictation language on the fly. When you activate dictation from the app and you're in the screen with the sound waves on the bottom, force-touch it and you'll get language options. This doesn't mean you can dictate in one language, and then change on the go to another one, but at least you can change languages for whole sessions without having to take the phone out. ",

For the past few years, my bowel movements have been disruptive to my daily living. While I have been adhering strictly to a gluten free diet for the Celiac disease, I’m still pooping astounding quantities every morning and throughout the day. Right when I wake up after I eat breakfast (some days with coffee, some days not so the caffeine isn’t the issue), I have to sit on the toilet for at least 10 to 20 minutes where I poop so much that it’s the size of a large Arizona Iced Tea can. I feel fatigued and drained for a while afterwards and try to replenish with fluids and nutrients, but the effect is always the same. I know I’m not suffering from cross contamination because I’ve been working at home and have been monitoring my meals very strictly. My vitamin levels have been pretty good lately too judging from my recent blood work so I’m clueless as to what could be causing this or if it’s normal at all.

However I don't know whether I should go for the 6GB or 3GB. Is the difference in price large enough to make a performance difference?2. For the CPU I'm thinking pentium G4560. Is that a good choice? Do you know of another CPU with a better price for the performance?3. Which motherboard should I go for? I'm not looking for fancy gimmicks just something that works well with the parts I picked and isn't expensive.4. 8GB of RAM should suffice I would say. Frequency 2400-3000 MHz is ok?5. Recommended power supply? CPU fan? Case?6. For those of you who are experienced with such builds: What else could you hope from this build? The Witcher 3 1080p medium settings? Or something similar?7. Are there any other things I forgot to mention?Your help is deeply appreciated,Signed, an aspiring ascendant.EDIT: Corrected dummy mistakes.",

He berated me for filling out the job application he sent me by hand, instead of filling it out via word (when it was sent to me as a PDF and I was not given any instructions either way, just complete the form, not that it needed to be typed). Anyways, we get over that hurdle, and he starts talking to me about my Spanish speaking skills. He thought he knew more than me because he was learning on Rosetta Stone. I majored in Spanish and lived abroad for 6 months. He had no idea what I said.Then he goes off on a tangent about how crappy the healthcare industry is in the U.S. (We're in the U.S...) and how crappy universal healthcare is, and how awesome some fitness app is on his phone. Then he gets a knock on his door. It's his 7 year old son, sick, and looking for his book. So my interviewer leaves to go get his book from his car. A few minutes later he comes back and apologizes. Then there's another knock on the door. The son doesn't want to sit in the lobby, he wants to sit in the room with us! So he gets to sit in on the rest of his dad's rant about the healthcare industry.Finally after an hour the interview is done and I stand up to leave. No hand shake. Seriously the most unprofessional interview I've ever been on. And it sucks because I really need a job right now. *sigh* I'm so frustrated. ",

Other that the actual text of the quote, for the sake of data curation I will also want to store various metadata like submitter user ID(taken from the chat API), date of submission, etc.Requirements:The total list of collected metadata fields is likely to change many times over the course of development, so the schema shouldn't be rigid. I don't want to spend time writing schemas at all. Ideally, I should be able to send over the DB interface a dict with random fields to create an entry.I plan to run the whole application stack a single node with  1 GB Memory / 30 GB Disk, so resource utilization footprint should not be large.The application is being developed in python 3.6, so the DB needs to have an API that supports it.The data needs to be persistent. I don't want to lose my slowly accumulated quotes anything due to a crash.Since I'm planning run the whole thing in Docker for educational purposes, it is preferable that a docker image exists for it.Since the users are going to interact with the DB via a chatbot, I need support for concurrent READ, CREATE operations.Non-essentials:The project is just a novelty thing for a small audience, so no need for stuff like scalability or distribution.Since the data curation will involve filtering, an indexing feature could be useful, but I'm not sure that there will be enough entries with similar enough schema for it to be a real benefit.Rejected candidates:* MongoDB: I've got experience with it, but it's too bloated for my humble node.* Redis: Looks like it is easy to use, but I've heard bad stuff about its ability to persist the data.* Codernity, buzhug: Doesn't seem to have a python3 API.* TinyDB: Doesn't seem to support concurrent access.* PostgreSQL: Requires rigid schema.",

We're here to talk about the time he married his cousin.Jacob was running away from his angry twin brother, who was trying to kill him. Not relevant. But on his mom's advice, Jacob goes to his uncle's hometown. Specifically to find a bride. Marrying his cousin was not an accident. Anyway.Jacob rolls up to this town and encounters this PYT fetching water from a well. He's smitten, this is some 'love at first sight' shit, and as it conveniently turns out this chick is Rachel, his uncle's youngest daughter. and his uncle's name is Laban and he basically owns the entire town and has lots of sheep. So Jacob asks Laban \"yo... who do I gotta pay to marry your daughter\" and Laban says \"no need fam, you just have to work for me for 7 years, but I'm not gonna pay you or nothing, and at the end you can bang my daughter\". Jacob says \"nbd\" and works his ass off for 7 fucking years, for free, to marry Rachel. Whether in all that time anyone actually asked Rachel if she wanted to marry Jacob remains a mystery.So 7 years pass and Jacob FINALLY gets his reward: banging his cousin. They do the thing with the ceremony and the veil and Jacob is married. HOWEVER, the *following morning* Jacob figures out the chick under the veil during the wedding (and afterwards ***cough cough***) was NOT RACHEL, it was some other chick: Leah. Turns out, Leah is Rachel's sister. Jacob marches down to Laban's crib to ask him \"what the actual fuck?\", and Laban was like... \"oh yea, I didn't think it was fair that Rachel was getting married before her older sister Leah, so I just switched them, I don't see the problem?\" and Jacob was like \"no it was definitely Rachel I wanted to marry, so.... can I marry her too?\" and Laban says \"yea sure, whatever. You can just work for me for another 7 years.\"So Jacob stayed with Laban and worked for free some more, but Laban let Jacob snatch up Rachel before completing his 7 years of servitude instead of after. Discount cousin marriage. Then afterwards Jacob had a thousand fucking kids with Leah and Leah's personal slave and Rachel's personal slave, but only two with Rachel, but she was still his favorite anyway and the other chicks hated her.

Once you get *good* at a martial-art, and begin to get into sparring, there's nothing quite like the feeling of knowing you could legitimately kick people's asses.Sure, lifting will get you big, but that's not really a sure-fire way to give you a deep sense of inner-confidence. The guy's who are great at martial-arts know that they can beat larger and stronger men in a fight, and that is a VERY good way to improve your frame. In fact, I would argue that committing to a martial-art is better than committing to lifting, but that's just me.",

Bruce Banner was transformed into a nerdy \"white knight\" scientist with girl problems and insecurity problems. He's the best character in my opinion because he seems so real. I could pick him out from any guy hanging around the engineering department at my college haha. And they made the Hulk a genuine monster again, an expression of Banner's ego and sexual repression. His and Betty's relationship is so fucked up but so real too. Which brings me back to my point many of the stale heroes from Marvel 616 are made human again. I know this is later on but when we had Ultimate Comics: Captain America we get to see just how different he is from the one in 616. Where as the 616 is much more comfortable in the world he's welcomed back to in Ultimate Comics: Captain America we get to see how alone he truly is and watch the all American \"manly man\" image he projects break down to reveal how uncertain he is about his place in society.

I rarely follow up on job applications and I don't know if it's hurting me or not. I know it probably couldn't hurt, but I assume they know I want the job if I'm applying for it, I shouldn't need to follow up to show them I really want it. I think if they wanted to reach me they'd let me know or contact me? Any other INFP's similar or do you have a different approach? Any advice for job applications and interviews? Thanks.",

You buy a part and then you follow the company on a quarterly basis. If it’s not going the right way, you might correct your estimate if it’s value. When a lot of people do this, the market goes through a “correction”.When it comes to currencies, it’s not really the same thing. You rather look at what the country that uses a certain currency produces on a yearly basis. A country that does well and has a high output and is stable, has a stable current. If it turns out Europe is doing worse than anticipated, the value of the Euro might be corrected. A correction.If a company suddenly turns out to be on the verge of bankruptcy, or if it simply disappears like Enron, we’re not talking a correction. We’re talking a depreciation close to zero (rarely 0, because there are often things of value in the balance sheets). If a country is in total war and on the verge of being eliminated, we’re not talking “correction”, we’re talking value depreciation that could very well become 0.A market correction is one thing. A burst bubble is something else. A lot of crypto currencies had tanked, yet people keep calling it a “correction”",

This is literally just after three months ago, bitcoin went from $600 to $200 in a matter of weeks, and took three months to get back up to $600 dollars.  I must admit that, since bitcoin was the first big cryptocurrency to reach its current heights, I doubt that many others will be able to compare to it, but that doesn't mean that there can't be multiple cryptocurrencies like there are national currencies.I was getting a new order of E-Cig liquid, and I got [this](http://i.imgur.com/GbFyYr9.png).  Don't doubt the possibility that this currency goes to the moon.  Money is just money to me, so spending a $100 to get 200,000 dogecoins is only $100 loss when I spend more than that each month to fill up my gas tank.Even if Dogecoin never gets up to the price of bitcoin, I'll still be happy being among a generally happier and light-hearted/funny group than the cutthroats in the current Bitcoin market.",

First match, unupgraded, I get put in a flat out T6 match with one T7 per side. I do extremely well with 90k damage dealt and three kills. After that, though, I have had no fewer than six games straight of T8 matches. Most with a heavy BB or DD presence. I'm talking three T8 BBs and a T7 or T6 (cannons become spitball launchers) as well as a couple of T8 DDs and a couple T7s and T6s (AP sucks against DDs, overpenning for minimal damage). It even struggles against T8 cruisers, failing to citadel almost always. And let's not forget the prevalence of Radar and Hydro beyond T5 making it even harder as I can't even hide in smoke to try and get some sort of penetration mechanic happening at close range. The only thing I have going for me is some okay torpedoes that are usually spotted from far away because of spotter planes or hydro.So, how do you play these \"glass cannon\" cruisers when all you are is glass and you cannon has been made a potato gun? Currently, I'm ending games with 8-10k damage being dealt because my glass armor is being shattered before I get much chance to even lob a few salvos of useless ammo at enemies.https://i.imgur.com/rslZ6Ww.jpgthis is basically what I'm seeing almost all the time.",

I went on to date / sleep with a few guys I met in bars and dating sites.  I met my new boyfriend and my ex is single. He texts me often and says that the photos remind him of our time together. He posts them to my wall for my birthday and tags me often on Instagram and Snapchat and Facebook whenever he uploads a photo of us. He said that he wants to remember me forever, even if I marry my boyfriend and have kids with him, and I do want to marry him. He knows that my boyfriend is insecure because he got rejected many times before meeting me and never dated or slept with anyone before me. He wants to make my future kids aware that we dated/slept together.How do I get him to delete the photos? Many of my sorority sisters and boyfriends fraternity brothers and football teammates (he plays football and is in a fraternity, and I’m in a sorority) think I’m with my ex and thought we broke up.I messaged my ex and he says that he wants to keep them up and tell everyone we dated, including my friends and boyfriend, and even my future husband and children.

And you will be ruled by them. Worship. Worship Trell and wait ... And, by coincidence, I've found a little detail while reading something about Amaram. When Dalinar made him Knight Radiant he gave him a cape of gold and red. There is no mention of why they choose those colors, but Amaram's colors are green and burgundy, so we can discard that and very cautiously assume that at least some order of Radiants wore those colours. Can you feel the tinfoil coming? Here goes my half cooked theory:First of all: let's us suppose Trell is Odium. The obvious objection is that Odium is trapped on Roshar, but! If I'm not mistaken we know that Mistborn Era 2 happens after the fifth book of Stormlight. There's plenty of time in the 3rd, 4th and 5th book for the Radiants to fully come back and for Odium to scape or be chased away from the solar system. My theory goes that he choose to go to Scadrial (why? I don't know, maybe he hates Harmony just because their intents are opposites) and once there, knowing the Radiants will arrive chasing him, decides to put the scadrials against the Knights Radiant, so that they will destroy one another. In order to do this he co-opts Trelagism, in much the same way that Ruin co-opted the Terris religion, and created the figure of a menacing \"men of gold and red\", who will come bearing the \"final metal\", i.e. the Shardblades and Shardplates. Then he enlists the help of the Set, and promises them power and riches if they serve him, although of course he doesn't talk to them directly. Instead he sends his servants, which we know 1) Can change their forms and 2) Have red eyes. Notice that all creatures of Odium in Roshar (the stormform of the Parshendi, the Thunderclasts...). I propose that they are some sort of Voidbringer that can Lightweave (remember that during the Desolations Roshar would be invaded by the Ten Deaths, which could be different types of Voidbringer).Points in favor: - it is implied that Odium can control Voidbringers against their will (remember Eshonai yellling inside her head). That would mean Odium knows how to influence people who have had their souls ripped, and could have taught that power to Leslie.Points against: - why would Odium choose trelagism specifically? there doesn't seem to be anything that would make it easier to co-opt that religion. Maybe the fact that trelagists thought their god was the stars would have fit with Odium coming from another world... I don't know.- Trellagists don't seem to have done much proselytizing. The only adherents that we know of are the Set and their minions. Maybe they want to destroy pathism and survivorism before coming out to the people?",

		"text": "The statement in my title is based on a recent event in the news. A 14 years old highschool girl stole a second energy drink while being drunk on the first one she also stole earlier. Each energy drink was the equivalent of 4 wine glasses and one coffee. Her friends saw that she blacked out but went to their classes after lunch while she stayed outside. She was later found dead in a small river near the school. Almost immediately, the company making the drink announced that it stopped the production of the drink. The father announced he was going after the company and started a movement against similar energy drinks. All local media (city of Montreal) is talking about is how bad those energy drinks are and how regulation should be made. Nobody is adressing the steal. Nobody is adressing that the owner of the store would most likely have refused to sell the drink upon seeing the (drunk) underage girl. All focus is on making legislation about such drinks and put a ban on them while the company is recieving a huge public backlash. Would have it been the same if the girl stole peanuts and was later found dead due to an allergic reaction ? Small bottles of alchohol ? Like those mini Jack Daniels we often see. Or, to another extreme, if she would have stolen a gun ?I think the public debate is putting his attention at the wrong place, but I'm open to be pointed out where I miss sensibility around this issue. Edit :The theft is not my main issue here. It's part of the story and I wanted to give as much detail as possible. I had two main points 1- The company cannot be responsible. I awarded two delta because the company likely used a loophole in the law to make the drink. We also have a moral responsability to legiferate about those kind of drinks.2- It's wrong that the public focus solely on  the energy drink and the company behind it. Why isn't there a discussion about her friends responsability and the store owner responsability. ",

Because of this, I’ve gotten in more than one altercation with an SJW, even some friends going down that road, mostly on social media. It’s hard on me because one part of me just wants to keep his head down but another one is sick of their dehumanizing bigoted bullshit towards most people. They are extremely judgmental and demanding of our attention, and oftentimes feel like crap after seeing a friend act like that.Things I’ve found that do not work when arguing with an SJW:Facts and Citations: They don’t care because “feels before reals.” I had a SJW friend tell me that a dictionary definition doesn’t matter. I was dumbfounded. Is there any way I can continue trying to use citation with them?Rationale and Compromise: They’ll always see me as either with them or against them. It could be something as little as preferring Pepsi instead of Coke, but now I don't see eye to eye with them and the friendship is over. 9/10 times I know that adding a counterpoint to my SJW friend’s Facebook post is going to affect our friendship.

Just today, I’m pretty sure a SJW that goes to my gym class is going to be pissed off at me because I disagreed with her shitty opinion of the May/Pac boxing match. What way can I continue to try to compromise with them without feeling like they burned another bridge with their hateful words?Muddying the Water: The same as using citation, they simply won’t care, and when confronted with an actual, obvious mistake, they’ll simply repeat it over and over to drown out the other person.What’s worked for me before:Personal Touch: They’re pretty sensitive once you get past that shell of insanity. When my friend was raving about all men being scum, I asked her what was going on in her life, was there something wrong, etc. I came to find out that she had just experienced pretty bad domestic violence, so we talked about that for awhile. This is deescalating and will only work with people that you know on a personal level. A similar approach that might work on strangers is trying to figure out if they’re really experiencing the things they’re complaining about, but that’s a longshot and could take awhile or be a waste of time. (Arguing with a stranger is a waste of time in general, I’m mostly here because the SJW mentality is very toxic on people close to me.)Trolling: When all else fails, riling them up can really make them look like an idiot. This is not a good longterm solution to arguing with fanatics, especially people you’d like to consider friends.Thanks for any help.",

The Suns are a fringe playoff team, and all of the others are either potential or guaranteed contending teams! And we didn't even have our best player for 3 of those games. The combined record for all of those teams at this point is 29-21. We will get our shit together.I do agree that yes, without Boogie, we should be a better team. But we are like what, 2-3 weeks into the season? We still have months ahead of us. If we still can't get it together by January, then yes, we should probably panic. But we are way too fresh into this year to write it off already. Coming up, we got Detroit, Brooklyn, Toronto, then we go east for a road trip to take on so not-so-intimidating teams like the Magic, the Hornets... We will be fine. And at least getting these tough games out of the way early on should make the rest of the season a bit easier!",

You’re actually paying for gas that is filling up the hose, ready to be pumped into the next customer’s car. Any additional gas you try to pump into your tank may be drawn into the vapor line and fed back into the station’s storage tanks.&gt; 2. It can ruin your car. Have you ever wondered why your vehicle won’t allow you to add more gas once you’ve been alerted that your tank is full? Because gasoline needs room to expand, your tank needs extra room for that expansion. If you try to top off, the extra gas you’re trying to add may actually evaporate into your vehicle’s vapor collection system. This can ruin the mechanism, making it work improperly, and cause your car to run less efficiently.Both are terrible but does the gas expand that much?  And am I actually filling the hose up again?  I thought the hose was always full.",

I beat the game before purchasing the DLC and decided I was going to get through that DLC in NG+, no matter how tough it got.  I finally took down OoK a few weeks ago, so I'm now at the point where I only need the following trophies for the Platinum:* The trophy for the ending when you allow Gehrman to kill you.* The trophy for Queen Yharnam* The trophy for acquiring all of the Old Hunters' WeaponsI decided to start a new character for my last play through for the third ending.My question is this - Will I need to collect all the Old Hunters' weapons in one play through for the trophy?  I think I missed a few.  The only one I'm certain I haven't acquired is the Rakuyo.  I'm hoping the Shark Giants are a little easier to deal with on a fresh run rather than NG+.  I may have missed a few others too though, I'm just not sure.I've got a lot of work to do on my Chalice Dungeons, so I'm looking forward to the Blood Drive next week!  I was adamant about soloing the bosses through the story, but I'll take all the help I can get to get down to the Queen.Thanks!",

Instead, I loaded three muslin bags with rice and buried them in the sugar for a few days.I like to think it helped, but I honestly don't know.I've since pulled the bags and put them in the oven on low heat to dry them out, as I'm concerned that they'll wick moisture and them mold...this leads to my questions:1. Should I use instant rice? I've been using regular long-grain rice2. How long should the bags be left in the sugar/how often should I swap them out or dry them to prevent mold?3. Is mold even a concern here?Thank you all!",

		"text": "Sorry for the essay, I wanted to provide extra context. I'll put my questions at the end if people want to skip to those.Background:Last summer there was a girl that I worked with. Near the end of the summer I became pretty interested in her and wanted to ask her out, in hindsight I should have been a little more flirty with her leading up to asking her out (my concern was she didn't know it was a date) but all in all it went well and she said yes. Really the only important detail here is I said something along the lines of \"lets get some ice-cream and go for a walk\" I suggested Wednesday and she (had a reasonable excuse) asked if we could do Friday instead.Basically I wanted to hang out with her, and she had an out and didn't take it. To me this suggests she clearly wanted to spend some time with me outside of work. I hope ice-cream and a walk is \"datey\" enough that she felt she was agreeing to something not totally platonic, I wouldn't usually worry about something like this but the fact that we had known each other for a little while before I asked her out makes me concerned that I had established enough of a friendship that any escalation on a date would take her by surprise.That Friday I said \"hey are we still hanging out after work\" and she had another (very very very good, family issue) excuse to why she couldn't. She asked if we could \"postpone\" it, but didn't specify a date.Again thinking back on this 8 months later the phrasing was brutal, almost like I gave her an out, but hindsight is 20-20. I'm not really worried about the fact that she didn't work with me to find another time, she had some bad stuff going on in her life, I'm sure getting ice-cream with me was the last thing on her mind.About a week later I flew across the country for my last year of university. She did message me basically saying, \"sorry we never could get gelato\" but we didn't really speak much after that until a few days ago.I had some meetings near where I worked last summer (she was working there again this summer, I am not) so I came by to say hello to everyone (almost everyone that works there is a good friend of mine). I wanted to ask her out on a date when I saw her but I couldn't get her alone, so instead I just made polite small talk about my plans now that I've graduated.I need to come by where I used to work tomorrow, and I definitely will run into her again. She was interested in hanging out with me last summer, I imagine its likely that she would want to hang out with me again.Is it that bad that I didn't ask her out the first time until working with her for a couple months, is the fact that I established a bit of a friendship and then became attracted to her a deal breaker?If not is it ok to ask her out again after not really talking to her for 8 months, if so is there a way to ask that shows my intent isn't strictly platonic? Something like \"We're not working together anymore...lets go out some time!\"?TLDR: Asked a coworker out last fall, nothing happened, want to ask her out again. Have I missed my window? is there an easy way to let her know I'm asking her out on a date?",

The whole idea of being dunked in water at as a sort of baptism would hint at that was it a book about man restarting civilization? What's it about vampires and a virus? What's it about a girl and her journey to save the world? Kinda, but the fact Amy is taking care of a lot during this novel would suggest otherwise. On the whole, the action sequences were incredible. I can't wait to see the battle sequins between Fanning and Amy in an abandoned New York City. Cronin frustrates me. He has the ability to create vivid portraits of characters and make you the reader, connect with them. In The Passage he did it with Carter, Wollgast, Amy's mother and Jonas Lear. In The Twelve, he did an amazing job with Grey. Who went from a loser pedophile to tortured confused hero. he also help draw out the character of Lila but not to a great extent but enough that she felt vivid. But, he can't for some reason do it with the main characters of this novel Peter, Alicia, Hollis, Sara, Michael, Caleb none of them feel fully fleshed out. They seem like cardboard cutouts of what hero should be with a little more detail. I was invested in any of these characters lives or emotions or romances. Even Amy, The linchpin of this whole novel could've used more details flushing her out on her experience with being alone after the end of the world. It would have made her more sympathetic and made me more connected to her. I also found it annoying in this trilogy there way too many false deaths. This isn't a comic book. If you're going to kill somebody, fucking kill him and show how that person's death affects the people around him. I don't know how Cronin can write a romance like the one between Fanning and Liz that makes me cry and not write compelling love triangles between the main characters. There were no moments between Peter and Amy that hinted at a romance it just sort of shows up randomly the same with Hollis and Sara, and Michael and Alicia. Just implied that off screen there's connections being formed. Plus in this book Peter looks really stupid, he has the opportunity to save hundreds of his people yet chooses to make a last stand and risk being entirety of humanity dying off. But then they end up on the ship anyways. And nobody seems to call him out for this. I never expected to identify and root for a character like Fanning so much. His story with Liz was one of the most compelling parts of the whole trilogy to me it was beautifully told and beautifully written. But his battle with Amy at the end was kind of anti-climactic. Yes there is that huge and awesome chase scene through an abandoned New York City but the conversation between them in the battle of my names that of been hinted at never happened. Plus I'm still confused at the end of The Twelve, how Wolgast was still alive. That really bothered me. But on the whole this trilogy was an amazing piece of fiction, with an amazing story that could've used more clear ideas about what it was trying to say in regards to religion and science. I look forward to seeing the movie adaptation and the TV adaptation and I hope they can do it justice.",

But why?Some of you might know the app \"Happn\" - if you don't - it basically tracks your movement and when you cross paths with someone who happens (hoho see what I did there) to have that app installed, that other person pops up in your \"newsfeed\" of people you've crossed paths with. Due to that app, I actually noticed how much the \"dating pool\" increases in a large city.I live in Luxembourg - a country with half a million inhabitants and tons of people crossing our borders every day to work. After having the app installed for 4 months, I crossed paths with 36 women (age range 18-26). Last weekend I traveled to London. After 3 days (Thursday - Sunday) I've crossed paths with 631 women (that have that app installed of course).To give you some numbers for my OkCupid search;This is our template:**Women - who are interested in men - ages 18-35 - located within xx kilometers of me - online within the last month.**10 Km - 0 Matches.25 Km - 29 Matches.50 Km - 57 Matches (57-29 = 28 different from previous)So for a radius of 50km - which is already for a lot of people (from what I've read on this sub) a HUGE distance and this is of course - within the last month online.So with 50km - online within the last WEEK - we have 33 left.This is honestly, a bit of a \"rant\" - more disappointment post - and eye-opening for everyone else, to maybe see how \"lucky\" they are considering their dating pool. Cheer me up with something, thanks.Edit; Clarifying - I used the app Happn as an example, that actually made me aware of this. Many comments already say it's bullshit, I never claimed the opposite. I'm not talking about the quality of that exact app or anything, just that it showed me the number increases.",

Regardless of the many times she's brought me down, deliberately embarrassed me, disrespected me and played with my emotions, some fighting part of me still tries to be nice to her. She's never really congratulated me on anything or driven me to push onwards, but is often willing to point out flaws and take her emotions out on me. A few weeks ago she won this showcase for her screenplay, so I congratulated her and came to her event. I also helped her proofread, edit, and perfect her screenplay, taking an hour or more out of my day to help her out.Recently, I had a huge success on an important exam for nursing school. Everyone congratulated me, even people I barely know - everyone except for her. She'd clearly seen it on my Snapchat story. I assumed she was busy and would acknowledge me later, but she instead responded negatively to something I'd posted earlier. She also texted me several times, and I didn't respond for hours waiting for some positive words on my achievement. After a few hours, I pointed out to her that I found it unfriendly that she saw my achievement, and did not even congratulate me. I have supported her through many things, and encouraged her several times. She knows how hard I work to get into nursing school, and this exam was a huge breakthrough for me. I felt super offended that someone I considered a friend could not manage one positive utterance. This turned into a big argument, where I deleted her from social media and she's not responding to my texts. She's just been saying with \"Yeah, I know I suck! Thanks for pointing it out!\" and self-victimizing herself, still no congrats. I feel like I have a right to be upset over this. Am I wrong?TL;DR: A friend that I've always supported could not manage to congratulate me on a huge achievement and I got pretty upset. Is this wrong of me?",

I would like to switch mainly because of safety reasons but also weight.  I won't need a laptop for school (probably, there may be the odd project) but I will need it mainly for photos.  All in all, I would care much less if someone stole the iPad versus my computer.  I guess, first off, is there a way to transfer photos directly from my camera to my iPad?  I did a quick Google search and it mentioned an SD card reader of some kind and an extra cable, I think.Second, this iPad doesn't have the most memory in the world (8GB).  Is there some other way I can store all these photos?  I have 5GB on iCloud and some on DropBox.  And I suppose there's always Facebook if I'm really desperate.  But if there are any other options, please let me know.  ",

Also interesting to note is that she's the youngest character but post-S2 she feels like she's the only adult in the show along with Quentin.- **Lena Luthor:** Instead of only saying how she's a genius and a chess master, she actually shows it by being the first to figure out Sam = Reign or by making her own fucking Kryptonite. She's not invulnerable to bad writing, though, because her intelligence is insulted for cheap CW drama for not knowing who Supergirl is. However she remains a very interesting and well written character who is ruthless to her enemies. She and Oliver together would be a force to be reckoned with.- **E-1 Laurel Lance:** 2 years after her death the show keeps shitting on her every chance it gets, but to me she'll always be the real Black Canary. Her death was a travesty as she did not even begin to reach her full potential, not to mention how she got through her demons like substance abuse or alcohol addiction and they were all for nothing.- **Sara Lance:** She's sassy, badass and also a very well written character, literally nothing not to like.- **Nyssa Al Ghul**: She should have been one of the absolute strongest fighters in the Arrowverse considering she was a lethal assassin since she was a toddler. I love her personality and I wish we got more of her interactions with Thea, Laurel and even Felicity (say what you want about her, their \"contest\" was funny as hell).- **Caitlin Snow:** While her Killer Frost arc has been a mess she's by far the best Flash female for me. Too bad she was nerfed after becoming good and the writers don't really know what to do with her.- **Marlize DeVoe:** My favorite character of the season on the Flash. She's an amazing scientist, a katana wielding badass and a very interesting character overall. I like how despite being less of a villain than her husband she's got far more development than he did and even managed to gain back her agency and authority from him.- **Honorable mentions:** Alex and Kara Danvers, Cat Grant, Jesse Quick, Black Siren, the Huntress/Helena Bertinelli, Amaya, Zari, Dinah Drake, Lyla Michaels.",

I mean, there's billions of people on this planet, billions.

Recently, I came across a notetaking app called Agenda for MacOS - and it’s going to be made available for iOS later this month. The developers opted for what’s called a “magazine subscription” where you have the option to pay annually for new features down the road, and then you can opt out once you’re happy with the feature set and just use what you’ve unlocked up to that point. There’s an iOS game whose name I don’t remember off the top of my head, and its developers increase the purchase price every time they add a new gameplay feature (new characters, maps, etc.).On the Mac side, some developers charge annually for all updates and tech support, but if you stop paying, you can still use the app with the updates up to your end of the billing cycle - you don’t get any subsequent updates or support.

However, I still need to decide on what monitor to get. Anything below £200 is fair game, has to be 1920x1080, 16:9, 24\" or less, yada yada.How much will response time matter, if I stay below or at 60fps? I'm eyeing the Dell S2415H, according to the internet it has about 5ms input lag, and 6ms response time. Is that good, or at least good enough for just the regular PS4? Keep in mind, I don't play shooters online or anything, I mostly just want to play Action RPGs like The Witcher, Dragon Age, Assassin's Creed, and all such games.Also, on an unrelated note, any of you that play Nioh should totally message me, so we can be co-op buddies once I actually pick it up!Thanks!",

ISTPs are so fucking hard to read it is not even funny anymore. All those little signs and symbols people normally send out and do? Not with an ISTP! When they think your funny they don't laugh, they just smile a bit. If you don't initiate a conversation there won't be any because an ISTP for sure won't. Communicating feelings is pretty much worthless because they can't understand them probably (it seems to me anyway).On the other hand they are really fun to be with. If you say they'd do something, they'll to it. You can do the kind of fun things no other type would do with you. And even more importantly, they constantly challenge you. Not on an intellectual level (not to great with abstract concepts) but as a person. You'll have to look at things from a whole nother perspective or die trying. All that bullshit talk you like, you'll have to drop it. All that ego and drama, instantly~all~in~crap? Forget it. ISTPs drive change and growth in any willing person and as an ENTP this is awesome. It is hard but I think it will make me a better person. There is much to learn.On a little more personal note: She is the single most difficult woman I have dated. I get periods where I just want to be with her, talk and make her feel wanted (she lives in another city) and then there are the times where I just want to give up, leave her alone and be a good ENTP again.Of this I am sure: If she is like any other ISTP, we ENTPs do not get along that well in our purest forms. We're just too different.  BUT we are hugely flexible and capable of tremendous change in our behavior. I you're willing to do that, it might just work out. At least for a while. That's what I'm hoping.",

I’ve walked into the playroom to puddles of pee all over the floor. He really doesn’t like the feel of diapers anymore. He’s three years old and has autism. He’s nonverbal, so our biggest obstacle has been communication. He never took to signing and just throws PECs cards on the floor. We’ve tried potty training twice before. We’ve done underwear, and letting him sit in wet clothes, except that water is one of his favorite sensory activities and wet clothes don’t at all bother him. We’ve tried a reward system, and all he does is throw a tantrum when he realizes he’s not getting the treat. The only thing I can think of is stripping him naked all day.

You sit, do nothing, and pay mind to your breathing, observing it as it's drawn in and released.Whenever an urge strikes you and proves overwhelming, utilize a micromeditation technique to lower its impact and fine tune your reaction. Close or keep your eyes halfway open, pay mind only to your breath, and what should happen is the impulse should lose its strength, simply because it feeds on your attention.The less attention given to an inner urge, the less power it has.Hopefully this will help.",

There's a couple who show up to our adult classes, I'd guess that they're between 10-13 years old, yellow and orange belts with some stripes. They have some experience and some good technique, but just the sheer size difference is of course a huge disadvantage for them. I rolled with one today and I was a little unsure of what to do against him. I probably went around 30% and played seated guard to let him try to pass my guard, and I'd allow him pass when he'd do a legitimate guard pass technique. I'd also let him submit me when it was reasonable. But I'm not sure if I'm being too patronizing and annoying by allowing them to do so much to me, but of course I don't want to go too hard and smash them or hurt them either. So how should I roll against kids? What's a good middle ground? Should I try to pass their guard also and submit them, or just play light defense against them? If it's not obvious, I'm in my early 20s and have almost no experience with kids, I wanna do the right thing ",

		"text": "Hello girls, After 16 kilograms weight gain, tremendous hair thinning, and horrible skin, my dermatologist prescribed a pelvic ultrasound. I was diagnosed with a cystic uterus of 20mm volume. I was absolutely overwhelmed with this “lifestyle disorder”, at a young age of 19 years, as it was not a hereditary disorder. It had to be because of my unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle. You see, when I joined law school at the age of 17 years old and moved out of home, I made a couple of unhealthy lifestyle choices which included vices and food. Everything about my life had changed the minute I stepped into law school. My food habits, my sleep schedules, my stress level, as a consequence of which, extremely unhealthy addictive vices to vent out the stress, low metabolic activities as a result of extreme workload, etc. You get the point. I F’ed up real bad; halfway through the 2nd year of law school, I weighed nearly 16 kilograms more than I did when I joined. I just thought it was the freshman “16”, and thought a little rigorous exercise in the gym and a strict diet could kill the excess weight. I had oatmeal, bananas, brown bread, eggs, soy milk, and everything the internet suggested, plus exercise. It did not work. I was still 5”7 and weighed 75 kilograms. After when I had been diagnosed with PCOS in December 2016, I was pouring over books, blogs, and all over the internet for a “cure”. After a week of reading countless words, I was extremely confused. I realised there is no definitive cure for this disease. My OBGYN prescribed birth control and this “pre-breakfast pill” called Normoz-20, which contains Chromium Picolinate, D-Chiro-Inositol, Myo-Inositol, and Vitamin D3 as active ingredients. Additionally, I’ve been taking a multi-vitamin of the composition of one-a-day to kill my fatigue, and Vitamin E gel capsules. It has been 6 months since I have been diagnosed with PCOS. It’s been a rollercoaster journey. From January to March I’d been dedicated to my body. I followed a good diet, yoga, meditation and medication. I felt great. There was definitely no visible change, but I felt better internally. I could pull-off an ‘all-dayer’ without much trouble, and had no trouble waking early in the morning, or keeping myself awake when needed. Then came April, finals month; you can imagine how it went. I was completely demotivated to see the weigh scale; my old clothes still did not fit me and I had an ugly pooch hanging, which I had to cover with my new mid-waist jeans; low-waists weren’t even last on the list of clothes I could wear. I covered my body with clothes that could hide it. I binged on all sorts of junk, while preparing for examination. I had developed an erratic sleep pattern, and returned to a couple of the vices that I had in the first year of law school. I was guilty, definitely. But, I had convinced myself that I had tried “enough” and was “tried and tired”. In May, I went to intern at an international arbitration centre. This was the hardest month of the disorder so far. I had to wake at 8 a.m. in the morning and keep myself awake till about 12 midnight, which I was finding impossible even with probiotics, multi-vitamins, and the PCOS pills prescribed. I did not find time or energy to exercise. Plus, I started eating the suicidal foods because I started hanging out with all the old friends, and they were eating it, so I could not control myself, is what I tell myself. 6-packs of donuts, carbonated sugary sodas, sugary fruit juices, Chinese food made of all-purpose-flour, white bread sandwiches, etc. You name it, I ate it. This month was also the worst for another reason: I started having blackouts. I would leave for work, get to the metro/book an Uber, and I’d start having an accelerated heartbeat, cold sweats, nausea, giddiness, numbing arms, etc. This happened about 4-5 times, and then I visited a doctor, who said it was probably a Vitamin B12 or Vit D deficiency and prescribed to get the blood work done. As of today, I have not got the blood work done due to shortage of time, but I got an appointment for this Monday. I feel extremely demotivated and disappointed. I do not know where to begin or how to plan my day, and how to eliminate this disorder. Last week I discovered r/PCOS, and I read several stories of women who have successfully defeated PCOS in a battle that lasted 5 to 10 to even 20 years. I needed support and advice in planning for this battle. Please help me, *cysters.* ",

So the next day I text her and unfortunately I'm awful at texting but decided to try to converse with her anyway instead of just setting up a other time to hang out. The conversation was short and uninteresting and I ended up not texting her back after her last text. The next night something similar happened with her not texting me back this time. A few night later I was back in the city where she lives (I live a half hour away) and texted her, got no response. I haven't made about attempt to contact her since then.Now this girl made it very obvious that she was VERY into me the night we met (she had just gotten off work so she wasn't drunk or anything, so I know that she was actually into me) and I clearly dropped the ball with the follow up.My question here is if there's any way to salvage this by calling her or texting her, and if so what do I open with?",

His feud with Meek and recent \"remix\" of Dram's Cha-Cha has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Especially the diss track \"Charged Up\" Where he attempts to diss Meek by saying \"No woman ever had me star struck/ Or could tell me to get my bars up\" Which is a reference to Meek Mills relationship and how she's considered the better rapper and bigger star. This, to me was more an insult to Nicki than Meek. It showed off, at least to me, Drakes lack of respect for Nicki, despite there purported friendship and relationship. To me it seems Drake is saying that to be star struck by a woman is somehow a mark against a man because a man is a man and a woman is a woman. It also says that Drake finds the fact that Nicki is a better rapper than Meek more of a knock against Meek than a point for Nicki because she's a woman, and woman don't rap as well as men. At least that's what's coming through to me. In addition is remix of Dram's Cha-Cha was pretty fucked up as well. Drake, this big name star basically took the song that was giving up and coming rapper a lot of press and stole it out from under his feet. Did he literally steal the song for him? No. But the fact of the matter is he took the song Dram samples for Cha-Cha and turned it into his biggest hit. Is that wrong? I'd say yes. Because it's not like Drake is another struggle rapper trying to hustle his way into the game, he's one of the most popular well known artists alive today so when he takes a song, even as a remix, it's going to overshadow the other artists at their expense while building up his own empire. I can't imagine he would have appreciated Wayne if he'd taken a song from him on his way up, remixed it and got all the credit and attention. Now it would have been a little different if they were both up and coming rappers, then the advantages are more or less leveled off. But Drakes built in fans and connections basically destroy any chance for Dram to receive credit or attention equally. To me these recent events have definitely wiped the shine off Drakes image to me. I know it sounds stupid but I really thought Drake was kinda like the rest of us in an Everyman sort of way. I know this isn't the first time nor the last an artist puts on an act, but these recentlu I'm wondering if Drake is really the guys he makes himself out to be. Is he a lover who cares for his women? A Chris Brown misogynist in disguise? A badass? Or a phony who pretends all but is really none? Maybe he's, as Earl Sweatshirt says, \"A culture vulture\" hopping from one trend to the next. What do you guys think?",

		"text": "No this isn’t a phone call. I know what some of you guys might be thinking, but it’s not a phone call. There’s someone who talks to me through my speaker when the phone is not in use, no apps are being used, and the only way to seemingly avoid hearing him is by turning my phone off. This all began about a week ago. Nothing out of the ordinary had happened as I normally just go to work, the gym, and head to my place that I share with my girlfriend. My girlfriend left last Thursday to go visit her family before school starts up again in the fall, and I was given some alone time to take care of the house and our dog. On Friday, I came home from work and did some light housekeeping. It wasn’t long before, lack of better words, I was fiddling the flute. Even though I have the house to myself I still like having privacy during my me time and went into my room. I was browsing various sections of the internet to find a video when I heard what sounded like distinct talking. My first thought was that I had a visitor. “Great” I thought to myself. Now I have to walk around awkwardly and wait until they leave. That’s when I noticed my dog wasn’t barking. Generally, she barks whenever someone’s at the door. So, I got up and checked. Laila, my dog, was laying on the couch staring at me as I walked out my room towards the living room I checked the door. No one’s there. Alright, whatever really, this gives me the chance to go back and practice my flute skills. As I went back to my room I heard some chuckling. “Alright, I cannot be hearing stuff” I thought. I stood in my room trying to pinpoint where the noise must have come from. Neighbors? No. Driveway? No. Then he spoke. “Oh I’m here by the way. I guess you haven’t figured it out yet” The man said. Startled I tried to focus a little more, when I realized it my phone. I picked up my phone, but there wasn’t a phone call in process, nor where there any apps opened at the time. “Don’t be shy speak” The Man Said. “Uhh Hello?” “Ahh nice you hear me good” “How… ummm… are you talking to me?” I asked as I played around with my phone trying to find how he’s communicating with me. “Oh… that’s not important” he said.Confused, annoyed, and still somewhat horny I just wanted this to end by this point. “What do you want?” I asked. “What I want is irrelative. I’ll do what I want regardless.”What the fuck is this guy talking about? Whatever I said. I turned off my phone and I kinda just forgot about it. I went to sleep late that night, and woke up late the next morning. I woke up, turned off my phone and was greeted by a number of text messages by my girlfriend. Mostly just goodnight stuff. “Ah you’re awake” the man said. What the fuck. Does he have some tracker on my phone? “You missed out on what I did last night” he continued “Don’t keep turning off your phone. I really don’t like that” I just ignored him. Maybe he hacked my phone, or something. I’m not the most tech savvy, but the cellphone store was still open so I decided to check it out. I turned off my phone and went to the store. I told them that I was getting interference with other calls, and after a bit of back and forth I managed to switch my phone. With Jump on Demand I had to pay some fees and whatnot, but it was better than dealing with this guy and who knows what he meant by “last night”. I updated all my contacts. Deleted the ones I didn’t talk to. Downloaded my most used apps. All was good. I spent my Saturday catching up and slight studying, since I’m still in graduate school but have a two-week break, and then went out to the bars with a couple of buddies of mine. When I came home I turned on my Xbox in order to get some gaming done before the end of the night. I realized I had to use the bathroom. As I sat there reminiscing about the night. I overheard people talking. At first, I thought it was Netflix. Maybe I had left my Xbox on and it had only gone to sleep. Prompting an automatic play when I turned it back on. Weird I thought but whatever. As I walked back to the living room I noticed my Xbox was on the home screen. Confused and still buzzed my mind drifted back to my phone. “Nah” I thought. Whoever was messing with me had gotten into my last phone. There’s no way it happened again. Then I heard it. “Please just let me go… I don’t know why I’m here.” A woman’s voice said. I recognized the voice, but I couldn’t pin point it. “Shut the fuck up you stupid bitch” the man said. The woman proceeded to let a blood curling scream, I dropped my phone to the floor. I must be losing it. The man started laughing hysterically. “See! This would have been last night, but you turned off your phone!” The man said. “Please help me! Whoever is fucking there please help me!” The woman screamed. “Don’t worry about her. She’ll be dead soon enough.” Fuck I thought to myself. Freaking out I called the police. When they responded to my house. I had no proof of what had actually happened. No phone records, nothing. The man didn’t speak when I asked him to, and I ended up looking like an idiot. They gave me a stern warning of prank calling the police and then went on their wayNothing else happened the rest of the night. The next morning as I was watching the morning news there was a lady who was found dead in the industrial part of the city. It was a former coworker of mine. She was stabbed to death. I realized why the voice of the phone had sounded familiar. It was her. Shaken a bit up, I wasn’t sure what to do. I didn’t know who to talk to. No one will believe my story so I have no idea who to talk to. I tried talking to the man through my phone but I wasn’t getting a reply. It wasn’t until the next night when I finally got a reply. I woke up around 2 a.m. to someone sobbing. What the fuck. Dazed and disoriented I thought it was someone in my room. It sent chills in my spine. I turned on the light, but there was no one there. Then I realized it was coming from my phone. I wanted to turn it off and ignore it. I couldn’t get myself to do it. So I asked the person “hello? Who’s there?”The crying came to a halt and sniffling commenced. “H-h-h-hello?” The woman said. Another familiar voice, but couldn’t place where it was from. “Hey… uhhh..new phone, who’s this?” I asked ( I know I’m fucking stupid, but I seriously thought someone was messing with me). “Please help. I don’t know where I am. It’s dark in here and there’s only a small red light and that’s where your voice is coming from. Do you see me?”“No this is a phone call” “Please help me.” She said as a door closed nearby. “Oh God. Please no. Please fucking help me! Please! Fucking don’t! Don’t! Get off me!” She screamed as I stood there helpless. Panicking I started yelling through the speaker for it to stop. I heard footsteps walk towards whatever was transmitting the sound. “Enjoy” said the man. It was quiet for a few minutes, and then the sound of vomiting commenced. It continued and it went on for what felt like forever. I couldn’t do anything about it so I turned off my phone. I couldn’t fall asleep. I went to work, and couldn’t concentrate. I kept refreshing my news feed to see if I could see something on the news about it, but nothing has came up yet. Yesterday was the creepiest of them all yet. “Hello, how’s it going?” the man said. I just ignored him. “Alright, well if you’re being childish that’s fine.” He continued “I know that you’re girlfriend come home on Friday around 2 p.m.”“How did he know that?” I asked to myself. Trying to keep myself from yelling at the phone. “Alright, well if you’re not in a talkative mood then neither am I. Make sure to call your girlfriend today and tell her you love her.” I sat there frozen what he had just said. Who was this guy? Anyway. Tomorrow is Friday. I tried talking to my boss about getting out work early, but he didn’t really seem to budge. I have no idea who to talk to about this. If anyone has any advice please help me. I’m thinking about calling out tomorrow and picking up my girlfriend myself. I don’t know. I’m even afraid to talk through the phone, thinking he’ll hear me. ",

The same seems to hold true for political parties, both mainstream and independent. If you can't come to an agreement, why not just keep your policies to your own local jurisdiction, and see how it turns out? And this way nobody has to compromise or deal with constant opposition. Instead they get to see the logical conclusion of their policies.Of course a decentralized system would also be dependent on the integrity of the democratic process being maintained within each jurisdiction, and most importantly, the ability of those who don't want to live somewhere to move somewhere else-- somewhere that shares their sensibilities. I want to keep the social contract as voluntary as possible, and I think a lot of discontentment could be avoided if we moved to such a system.",

I was in a very pissy mood that weekend because my period started (five days late) and therefore the entire week of alone time my husband and I got would be disrupted by it. MIL was worried and kept asking the whole weekend if she’d done something wrong to upset me. We tried to be discreet about it but it got to the point my husband had to just come outright and tell her, “Mom, her period started, leave her alone.”By the end of our alone week, my period was light enough that my husband and I said screw it and we had sex anyways. It was Friday night, and the very last night we’d get to ourselves before having to leave bright and early to go swap out again. Well....all it takes is once. Fast forward a few months, and we decide it’s time to tell the grandparents. Husband called his mom and announced, telling her how far along we were. I can’t remember if she did the math herself or if we told her that it was the week they had the kids, but her first response was “But I thought she was on her period that week?”“Uh, yah, but why does that matter?”“Well, how’d she get pregnant? What on earth were you guys doing?”Uh.......what?Needless to say, a fight ensued. My husband didn’t take to the line of questioning very well and snapped (they already don’t have the best history). The whole thing ended with her crying, saying that it was a horrible way to find out about her new grandchild. Sucks for her I guess, because it’s the last grandchild she’s getting from us. Maybe if she’d minded her own and just been happy for us, it wouldn’t have been so “horrible” for her. ",

Guys mean mugging each other and then postering up for a fight over the most mundane and insipid things, explosive arguments happening over some minor disagreement about a fictional character or video game, yelling and slamming doors for seemingly no reason, etc. The list goes on.You also see this in society at large. The vast majority of wars have been started by men, school shooters, mass murderers, and serial killers alike are all predominately dominated by males. Yes, you could make the argument that men are simply encouraged to be aggressive by society amd traditional gender roles, and also that whole testosterone argument, but, even then, society has historically been run by men as well so we only have ourselves to blame for the roles that we have imposed on both genders.",

Out of curiosity -- I specified I wanted an IgG test for HSV. There was some confusion around which test was available through the lab, so I wanted to see what test you used.\"She mutters something about a rapid response plasma test, which sounds unfamiliar to me...so I asked her to explain it to me.She looks it up, and discovers that it's actually for syphilis, and that despite asking for a full panel and specifically for IgG, they actually hadn't tested me for HSV. Hopefully, they've got enough blood leftover to run it. If not, I'm getting poked again in an hour or so.So...when you go in, be SPECIFIC about what you want to be tested for. Then verify that they did what you've asked. Lots of medical jargon and acronyms can be confusing, and if you take folks at their word, you might end up lacking results you asked for, despite your best efforts!PSA.",

I was out in the stands in right field with a few other kids trying to catch homerun balls. I never actually managed to get one of the balls. Anyways Edgar comes out to the outfield to play catch and warm up. Some other kids and I are yelling at him trying to get his attention but he just keeps on playing catch, ignoring us. He's playing that game where every throw you take a step back.  I give up and go to our seats. We were somewhere in the 100 level along the first baseline but closer to the outfield than home.  Edgar and the guy he was playing catch with are now spread really far apart and he's actually kind of close to us, so I call out to him and he waves. I got excited and ran down the very lowest row, right next to the grass. He finishes warming up and walks toward me. He tosses me the ball he was playing with and I catch it. I yell for an autograph. He says he doesn't have a pen and keeps walking.  Not so fast, Edgar. You forgot it was the early 2000s and gel pens are all the rage. I happen to have a pen in my pocket. A lime, near highlighter green gel pen.  I inform him about my pen and ask for him to sign the ball. He obliges and asks me to toss him the ball and the pen. He signs the ball and tosses it back and then the pen. Some other kids are noticing the situation and are flocking in hopes of a similar exchange, but Edgar had already turned and was bee-lining it out of there.  At first glance I thought he hadn't actually signed the ball. Upon further inspection I was able to locate the signature. The lime green pen against the off white leather of the ball was really hard to see. After spending a few moments staring deeply down at the signature and showing it off to my dad and some other kids I put it in my front sweatshirt pocket for safe keeping. I spill ketchup and root beer on my sweatshirt and the Mariners lose to the Angels, (fuck Mike Trout). We leave and I fall asleep on the car ride home. I wake up the next morning and I can't find the ball. I can't find my sweatshirt either. To my horror I discover my mother had thrown my sweatshirt in the washing machine and had thought the autographed ball was just a baseball, and tossed it in the backyard where our dog, (RIP Callie 199?-2008), had her way with it. There was no evidence that Edgar ever signed what was left of the ball. I cried. Without the ball and signature there was no evidence my story ever happened. My friends never believed me. To this day I can't look at a green pen without dying a little inside. ",

Basically I was always trying too hard, constantly seeking validation in my work because I was afraid of making mistakes. This stems from my childhood experiences with an semi-abusive older brother who was pretty much the one who raised me because my parents were always working. There were some other things, but ultimately this is what caused me to not do well in corporate environments. I didn't realize this until recently when some people went above and beyond for me in order to get me to realize I had a serious problem (the getting black-out drunk and riding my motorcycle thing should have been a big clue for me). I've had IT jobs off and on since 2010 and never held a job longer than a year because I didn't know how to handle office politics. I did well enough at my last job and I think if I asked for a job with them again they would rehire me, but too many of them know too much about me and I feel like it would color every interaction I have with them moving forward. I don't want people walking on egg-shells around me; I just want to be treated like any other employee and I don't want to have to wonder if this person knows what happened to me when I was younger or not. I've been A\+, Network\+ and CCNA certified but they are all expired now. I'm willing to pick it back up at A\+ and start from the beginning again, but I'm worried I could be wasting my time doing it. I still have some self-esteem issues and doubt my abilities, because as I mentioned earlier people seemed to be walking on egg shells around me. Because of this self-doubt I sometimes wonder if I should just think about doing another career. I don't really know what my strengths and weaknesses are, but I seemed to have done well in IT before? Right now I just need to be making money and I feel like my only real marketable skills are in IT, but because of my dog-shit work history I'm on the fence about trying again. Can anyone offer me some guidance or insights?",

(not sure how to word that. But I have to put in 4% in order for them to match 2%, if I put 2% they only match 1%....etc)* currently contributing 15% * I am able to do this because I live with parents rent free so I can save for a house.* still on parents insurance until I am 26. So that helps as well.* I want to be out of my parents house preferably by this time next year.Should be no problem right? But here is where it gets expensive:* I'm engaged and getting married and weddings are expensive. planned date is November 2017 so we have plenty of time to save.So I know I can't blame her for being expensive, I agreed to have a wedding and all that. And we are cutting corners and compromising where we can, which is great. As we plan and put deposits on things I have been able to do it without dipping into my savings, but it has reduced my extra savings. Some months are worse than others depending on what it is that we are buying.My question is what the hell should I be doing to best suit my goals. Should I reduce the 401k contributions for short time and put that money into home savings? Maybe be able to avoid mortgage insurance if I can get a bigger down payment? Should I even be putting that much into my employer 401k? Maybe I should just put in 4% to get the match and get a roth IRA for the rest. Maybe I should wait until I have a house to start that though if I want to maximize my home savings. I am hesitant to reduce my retirement savings because I know putting in more now will pay off bigger in the future. But at the same time I really don't enjoy living at home (as great as my parents are) and I want my own place again.Thanks for reading.",

However, I've lost my best friendships since I entered college, and it's driving me crazy.When I started college, I lost contact with some of my best \"friends\". At the time, I didn't really pay attention, as I was never that close to them to begin with. The only one I had left was this guy called \"Fred\", whom I've known since I was 8 years old. Now, Fred has a history of abandoning friendships from one day to the other, but it had never affected me before.One day, after getting a girlfriend, Fred just stops talking to me. Like, zero contact. After three months of silence, he sends me a wall of text, explaining he's at a different stage in his life right now, and that he doesn't need me, because after all \"friendships are momentary pleasures. I wish you good luck with your new gf :)\". And that was it. I've known him long enough, and I know that he only drops male friendships when he has a crush on them and can't deal with it (he's gay, but still a virgin). When I express my concern to some common friends, nobody gives me a straight anwser, only saying \"could be, could be,\" Like they're in some kind of joke. Everybody treats it like it's no big deal, and yet I feel horrible about it to this day.The same thing repeats itself. I had a friend from college, called \"Ana\". Ana and I get into some fights occassionally, but nothing big. However, things started to change soon. Most of my friends said Ana and I would make a cute couple, but I found it would make things awkward between us. She's emotionally distant for those things, so it was always difficult getting closer than \"hey, let's study together and talk about movies\", so I dropped it. One day, she invites me over for food and drinks. She never does this, she never goes out with anyone like this. Once we do go out though, she eats in an awkward manner, always looking at the tv on the wall of the restaurant, commenting on everything and never looking at me. I was gonna let it slide, but by the next week she started getting aggressive over petty things (as in \"Oh you do not want to come to school today 'cause you're sick? I'm gonna block you\"). Suddenly, she's joining this debate club, got some new friends, and ditched our group. It really hurt me, since I thought we were close. Six months have passed, and she's trying to treat me nicely again, as if nothing happened, but I'm still reluctant to let her in.All of this has repeated itself again and again. My best female friend left for france, so that's a bummer. I played a stupid joke on a past friend from high school (tried to hook another friend with his ex, and I had the gall to ask for the girl's number to this friend), and of course he now hates my guts. I don't know wether I'm screwing up everything, if it's a lot of coincidences, or if it's half and a half. tl, dr: I'm losing a lot of friends over random and petty things, and I feel more lonely than ever. I doubt my ability to maintain friendships over a long time, like my parents did all their lives. How can I get better?",

I have gotten to rank 2 before and stopped trying to grind out of boredom (was playing a netdecked undertaker hunter back in Naxx).  This deck has worked really well in this meta so far, and while I'm sure it's not perfectly refined yet, I'd love to see what a pro player could do with the list both in how it's played and how it is teched/refined for the meta.List: http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/907349-midrange-paladinA few card choices that I haven't seen much of:Dark Conviction: This card has been incredible in this deck.  It can be used offensively and defensively, on enemy and allied minion alike.  A turn 1 1/1 divine shield minion followed up with turning it into a 3/3 can be a powerful way to take the board early.  Later in the game, using it to turn the lich king from an 8/8 into a 3/3 can be really nice, as well.  This card has been critical for my win ratio.Skelemancer: This is the other card that has massively exceeded my expectations.  It feels like a 5 mana 2/2 would be waaaaay too slow for a midrange paladin deck, even with the powerful conditional deathrattle.  But, with double defender of Argus, double Spikerided Steed, and Double Bonemare, coupled with the fact that your opponent is very unlikely to want to clear it on their turn when it's just a 2/2, means that you can almost always hit it with a taunt giver to force them to trade into it.  It curves out perfectly with Spikeridge, and can make the board state incredibly awkward for your opponent.  Even if you don't get a taunt giver, it's great against mage and priest (if they have already burned potion of madness, which if they have it, they usually will since you have so many good targets for it early), and warlock simply to prevent AoE from happening.The rest of the deck is pretty standard for a standard midrange list, but like I said, I'm sure it could use a little improvement...but even as it is, I'm doing pretty well in the meta.  It crushes mage and priest right now (although I have gotten wrecked by spellbender on a spikeridge steed), and as long as you underestand how calibrate your board width, you can beat jade druid pretty easily as well.  Midrange token druid is pretty tough because of all of the buffs, but Sunkeeper Tarim can get you the board back very quickly if they go all in on a spreading plague + buffs play.  Once you beat both of their spreading plagues, they are helpless to beat you because your single minion value is way better than their single minion value.Anyway, just figured I'd post the list I'm using.  If anybody tries it out and makes changes, please feel free to send them to me.  I'd love to have somebody better than me make some suggestions.",

One day MB got mad at me because I told her I could not do overnights (overnights were never discussed the interview and if it had been I would have never taken the job.) She proceeds to tell me that I am an immature piece of shit and for a 23 year old I should start acting my age, that every reference I gave her happened to tell her that I was an awful, messy and nasty person (yet she still hired me) and that she was going to make sure that I never got offered a nannying job again. Some how I managed to stick it out with this lady 4 more months after this all went down, which I realize was a huge mistake. About a week ago MB decides to tell me that she has found another nanny and this upcoming week is going to be my last week with her. So me being the polite person that I am, for the past, I texted her every single day asking her what time she would need me to come in. And without fail, EVERY SINGLE DAY, ten minutes before I about to leave the house, I receive a text message saying she does not need me to come in. So for the whole entire last week of working for her I didn't work a single day. Part of me is extremely thankful because I needed to get out of that situation anyways, but the other part of me is extremely mad because MB knew that I had just moved into my own apartment and really needed the money. Any advice on how to deal with these situations if they ever come up again in the future? Do I contact Care.com about the MB? And on the plus side during that week off I was able to find a new job that was offering $10 more than I made with her and the family is amazing!",

Based on the first definition, I'd be considered an extrovert in that I'm not a homebody, I love being up and out and around people and surrounded by noise and bustle and colors and stimulation. The energy drain comes from human interaction alone. I can go out to a festival or a convention all day and not be tired, but if I go with a friend, or see lots of people I know, I'll be exhausted, because the root of my introversion comes from finding *interaction* draining, not stimulation. It seems like a lot of material w/r/t introversion place emphasis on quiet, contained solitude, which is nice sometimes but that's not really how I roll, even though I definitely consider myself an introvert in the sense that most of the time I'd rather be doing active and stimulating things *but by myself*, and human interaction is inherently draining. Is anyone else the same way?",

		"text": "TL,DR: Fucking read it, I typed this shit out on my phone. Evan Peters if for some reason you are seeing this, I apologize. I don’t think you are a bad person, but you should probably stop reading. First and foremost, you all are obnoxious as fuck when it comes to Peters. There are absolutely times where I think his performance is positively adequate. But you all treat his acting skills as if he were the second coming of Christ. There is a reason that he doesn’t get recognized for his acting ability, and that is because it is nothing special. I will expand later.Looks-wise (completely objective I know), he’s a 7. Maybe a 7 1/2. Definitely not an 8. Again, you all are so fucking annoying when it comes to talking about how hot Evan is, and any screen shot of him throughout the series is free karma on this sub. I only bring up his looks (1) because it adds to the point of how fan-girly you all are and (2) I think his look adds to how miscast he has been throughout the series since a lot of his characters (Tate, Kyle, the Freak Show Lobster, and Kai) are seen as gorgeously too-attractive to resist. More on that, I think Peters has a very....unfortunate look. I don’t mean he is ugly by any means, but every year I think he looks too old to be cast in the young stud role (Coven and to a lesser extent Murder House) and too young to be taken seriously as the more mature characters (Asylum, Hotel) and sometimes a weird mixture of both (Kai). Murder House- Evan Peters was a convincing high schooler in Phil of the Future. In 2006. It isn’t in heard of in Hollywood by any means to have 20-somethings play high schoolers and it wasn’t super distracting for me this season. However, it does become jarring when Tate is both a tortured teenager and then a mature evil mastermind responsible for birthing the anti-Christ. Luckily for him, he was consistently paired with Taissa as opposed to the more veteran actors. Coven- Here was my first main gripe with his character casting. All of the other inmates in the Asylum were Middle-aged. This one is more nit-picky but his character was presented as home-owning, progressive, has his life together equal to these other characters and he just wasn’t. He was also out-acted by every single other main actor that year. This is also the first of many times multiple girls throw themselves at him and fight over him. Coven- Gotta give him some leeway for this season because, lol he was a zombie for most of it, not his fault. I actually think he did a pretty good job with the physical acting considering how few lines he got. But then this lends even less credibility to the women fighting over him. It had to be because of his looks since he doesn’t have any fucking personality this season. However, for all its faults, Coven was a fucking power house of acting ability. Lange and Paulson at this point were the strongest carriers of the series, and then adding Bassett, Bates, Gabrielle (?), and LuPone (?) pushed him farther down the list of top actors in the series.Freak Show- Still the only season I haven’t watched more than once, my least favorite, and yet another example of muslyiole women throwing themselves at Evan’s feet. Am I crazy? But I will withhold my judgement on his acting on this one.Hotel- Probably my favorite season of his, I thought his acting was awesome. If only he didn’t look like a teenager playing dress up. “But wait” you say, “weren’t you just complaining up there that he doesn’t look like a teenager”. Yes, you fuck. Roanoke- Chatacter wise I like this also, as his age difference with the others is a plot point and he doesn’t really have that much screen time to flub it. His ghost character was good and his short-lived obnoxious actor character was good also. No complaints this season. Cult- Not finished so my final thoughts will be TBD, but so far his character is inconsistant at best (but I will attribute that to the writing more than the acting). I don’t know what the directors are asking for, but his switch from the opening scene crazy TV humping to the cold, calculated mastermind that can I guess see the future and manipulate literally every single person he comes into contact with, but is also so incredibly hot that just his dick (yes Meadow had other issues) can cause somebody to go on a mass shooting spree/suicide is messy writing. I don’t think his acting is bad, but he has done nothing special and I absolutely do not believe him as somebody that people look to with their lives. His inspirational speeches have been meh and the characterization is lazy. Can’t wait to see you all get butt-hurt about your Lord and Savior. The sad part is that this might get down-voted so fast that nobody will even see it to have the conversation.",

However, once Goku finally perfects Ultra Instinct against Jiren, he still gets hit and even knocked back multiple times when the body is supposed to be acting by itself. This got me thinking: Is Whis' version of UI naturally superior to Goku's due to having it for presumably millions of years while Goku was just a rookie? Or can UI be negated if one's opponent posseses extreme power and speed? After all, even Whis himself stated that he couldn't even touch the Grand Priest in a fight (although I'm 99.9% sure that GP has UI too). I still think MUI Goku wouldn't be able to touch Whis if he was serious.Thoughts?",

It's his biggest hobby, he's even the president of a local \"Bad Movie Club\" (both cult ones like Roar and new ones like Grown Ups 2). I grew up with film nerd parents but he didn't watch a lot of movies as a kid/teen, so he made it his 2017 New Years Resolution to watch 100 \"iconic\" movies throughout the year. By iconic, we mean very critically acclaimed films, cult films, ones *everyone* has seen, stuff like that. Thing is, he hasn't really known where to start, so he's been slacking. I thought it would be a nice birthday gift to make him a list of 100 Must-Watch movies, get it printed onto a poster at Staples, and tack it onto our wall as a checklist.I've already added some films that were favourites of my parents and I growing up: Pulp Fiction, Clerks, The Royal Tenenbaums. But I'm only 22 so I haven't seen 100 iconic movies either! Any help would be very much appreciated :) thanks!",

I thought I would write a quick summary post so that everyone who doesn't understand the format gets a better idea of what the fuck is going on.The Format:A bunch of former contestants 50% guys and 50% girls go to a fancy resort in Mexico.  They are given bunk beds, plenty food, and only two drinks an hour from our friendly bartender Jorge.  At this point, they are encouraged to get together ~~hook up~~ find love over the course of a little over 2 weeks (TWO WEEKS).  Every episode, the producers will send in an additional man or woman or two.  There are date cards given to specific people to invite whoever they like on the dates.  They have these dates and pretty much the entire episode is dedicated to these dates or the continuous cocktail party that happens back at the hotel.  Then there is a rose ceremony.  If men got added to the group that episode, then the women will give the roses out, and vice versa for the men.  The idea is that you are encouraged to form couples so that your partner will (in theory) give you the rose and you two will continue your paradise journey together.  But because the group with the smaller number of people always has the roses, there is a fight among the people who haven't coupled up to woo the wild cards to get to stay.  Every episode, there are less and less people added until it's mostly just couples and the trashy few who managed to stay around despite not having a permanent partner.  At the end of the season, the remaining couples are given a choice: break up, propose, or continue the relationship and see what happens.  Most couples break up, but some get engaged.  Marcus and Lacey got engaged in BIP1.  Jade and Tanner got engaged two seasons ago.  Carly and Evan, and Amanda and Josh got engaged last year.  Who will get engaged this year, making the biggest mistake since my friend moved in with a girl he met on a plane after knowing her for all of a week?  Stay tuned and find out.",

Another kid kept mixing up French and English so when I put the tissues back a few inches away from where they normally go, she said \"Non, ça isn't supposed to va là!\"And perhaps the best for last: A little girl who's barely 2.5 and speaks French very well, but randomly, was supposed to be putting on her shoes when she looked at me seriously and told me: \"Mes pochettes, il y a beacoup d'espace dedans!\" ",

Trying to get some flags and get killed by retarded camper kids while my team isn't even trying. The amount of noobluck also raised to a huge level. Noobluck is for me when I start shooting first, shoot them in the head several times and when they start shooting I die instantly although he should be already dead. Also getting shot around the corner is fucking annoying, there is nothing you can do about it and it happens at least 4 times per game. All of this makes BF3 a 0 fun game at the moment for me. It can't be that I have to be in the epic winner team, winning with at least 400 tickets difference to be able to enjoy the game?! ",

I don't think I've ever been drunk (I think I just felt sleepy and never good like supposedly people feel). I've only drunk out of politeness (e.g., champagne at weddings) or forced myself through willpower to prove I could do what others do normally.The reason I haven't: I grew up in a physically/emotionally abusive alcoholic household, my father drank nightly and would regularly hit or there was constantly threats of violence against me and my brothers. Long story short, ever since I was a teenager the smells and sights of people drinking makes me anxious at best, have panic attacks at worst.I know where this comes from and I know it's not my fault I turned out this way. But, the world being how it is, it's wrecked my social life. I realized I just couldn't deal so I mostly kept to myself most of my adult life; I avoided any social situations where there'd be drinking - i.e., almost all. I've lost a lot and missed out on a lot. I'm approaching midlife and I have no wife/kids, no friends. I don't think (starting) drinking is the solution to this. But, I am starting a lot of therapy now. A goal is to desensitive myself to the trauma trigers so I can function better around other people drinking. I'm wondering whatelse my goals should be here (if you have any advice?). I don't think I want to become a drinker, but part of me wants to do it to prove to myself I can do it and be OK with it, and wondered if it might help me deal with other people drinking - i.e., further desensitize myself. Is that stupid? I just feel there'd be something exillerating/vindicating in the sense that there was this thing I was afraid of for so long, and I overcame/conquered it. And I feel like (successfully?) drinking is part of that. But I don't even know what to think. This is such a hard issue and I'm so confused and hurt and saddened by everything that's happened. Part of me just wants to just go and give up sometimes, like I'm just not made to function in this society and I should just become a hermit. And I feel so alone because 99% of society can't even relate to me. Sorry to rant. It's very sensitive to me as a topic and I'd certainly appreciate and advice, guidance, or perspective you could give.",

Turn on your tv and watch literally any show or simply just look at most commercials. 99% of the time the people you see will be very attractive regardless of their race, gender, or supposed age. I wouldn't mind if they were 'normal' attractive, if that makes any sense, but they're usually drop dead _gorgeous_ with perfect symmetrical features, well-groomed hair, fit toned bodies, flawless teeth, no scars, bruises, etc, basically people that are meant to be average look like supermodels. This is especially true for most mainstream American media. Most other shows that I've seen from places like the UK, Australia and such typically have average looking folks populating the cast with a reasonably attractive person here and there, but nowhere near the Greek god levels seen in the USA. I believe this negatively impacts our society in a few ways. Let's face it: Most people in real life range from decent to below average physically. There are plenty of people with strange and unappealing features (warts all over their scalp, uneven body shape, abnormally large nose, ears or feet, etc) and also people who are off outting in other ways (morbidly obese, mentally ill, narcissistic personality). By constantly only showing exceptionally good looking people in our media I believe we are subconsciously giving rise to people being insecure and ashamed of their own features as they try to emulate the ludicrously high standars lf what they see all around them. Not every man is 6'2\", ripped, with a beard and a handsome face and not every woman is curvaceous fox with large breasts, thick thighs, a perfect bouncy butt and a slim and youthful face. We should simply focus on accepting ourselves and doing what we wish and not whether or not would some stranger want to have sex with us. By showing more average people in our media and advertisements, I believe we will give rise to greater body positivity and people being judged not for how fat their ass is or how cute their face looks, but rather for their character and ingenuity as a human being.",

There are also students living in college dorms and accomodations that family members support them with, so I don't think it is true financial independence but only an illusion. The argument is that any guy who is living separtely from family is seen as more mature to potential girlfriends.The guy could be living with a host family in a homestay program, shelter...etc",

		"text": "I got into a huge fight today with my parents that is making me think a lot. Apparently, whenever I visited them (which is usually once a week on weekends), I look unhappy. I don't really feel unhappy but they think I am. Plus, they don't like that I don't talk to them when I do visit, which basically makes my visit pointless (aside from driving my dad's car for practice and eating my mom's home cooking). Anyway, I realized a few weeks ago that I actually hate the neighborhood they live in, which I also grew up in, and I also just feel a bit of shame and discomfort around my parents that I don't really feel around anyone else. I have no idea what caused this, but I'm going to guess it's just that when I was growing up, the differences in interests, the seeming lack of interest in my interests, the dismissal of any problems I was having because my parents didn't think they were a big deal, etc. contributed to this weird mental barrier that just keeps me from feeling 100% at ease with them. For example, when I was younger in high school, my parents dismissed my concerns that I might be depressed and just told me to \"fix my attitude\" and treated it as not a big deal because no one in our family has a history of depression. Then there were times where my dad would basically call me a \"motherfucker\" or other things just because I messed up in some way. I feel better now but it definitely made me more hesitant to talk to them about certain things like I'm treading on thin ice all the time at 25 years old. I feel more at ease with my friends and coworkers than with my parents and that isn't normal to me. I just have no idea what to do. I tried to talk to them about all this today but they didn't seem to understand or listen and disregarded a bunch of my concerns and then it devolved into me screaming at them and telling my dad to shove his opinions up his ass. So I'm sitting here in my apartment wondering whether there is something wrong with me or if they're to blame for this partly as well. Tl;dr: got into fight with parents, realized I'm ashamed and uncomfortable around them, what do? ",

Basically once we were in the air I put my checklists away (to cut down on the stuff in my hands between sectional/flight computer/knee board/pen etc) and flying a 172 everything is straightforward anyway. So once he cut the power on me I set best glide found the nearest runway below etc and landed great. I thought all was good but debriefing he asked why I didn't run a proper emergency flow or checklist to get an engine restart, much lest any more checklist beyond pre-flight/taxi/takeoff. Talked it over with my instructor emphasized the use of checklist even if its just [&gt; set power &gt; cruise complete] and the whole backwards \"L\" for a restart on engine failure. I just tunneled on the landing because that was all that we ever did in practice instead of what I could still try in the air. I know why he needed to bust me on it but it was still demoralizing for having a smooth landing and has me a bit worried again for my retest tomorrow. If all that was on my notice was my use of checklist and emergency procedure from altitude is that all that I will be retested on? I talked with my instructor and he said theres no cross country/maneuvers/hood procedures I'd have to go through if its not remarked on but is there anything I'm missing or should look at again just in case we've forgotten something? Like having to redo AV1ATES/AROW/weight&amp;balance/weather before flying again or mapping a diversion to go for the emergency simulation. Thanks for any pointers or help, and if it's a bit of rambling thanks for reading anyways.Edit: Got it this morning guys!!

I came off a Kawasaki Ninja 650 sport bike so I'm just trying to sort out what's normal for a Harley and what may need attention being 10 years old.Biggest thing I noticed riding it is it feels like the front suspension is kinda loose, over uneven surfaces it kinda feels clunky and I don't know if there's some worn out bushings somewhere or if that's just a Harley thing. At speeds above 50 or so I also feel an ever so slight front end wobble.Next up is the starting. I'm not sure if the previous owner just ran the battery low and it never completely recharged, but it doesn't seem like it has a ton of juice to turn over this engine. Seems like it only has  enough juice to crank over about 10 seconds if it doesn't fire up. I been keeping it on a charger just to ensure it completely charges, but I was just wondering do batteries have a hard time turning this 1200 over?Next thing is the exhaust, it has Hooker chrome exhaust(chrome shields, pretty sure the pipes are black), but in just one day of riding, I noticed the front chrome tube(heat shield) is starting to discolor, is there anything I can do about that? Then there's mods, I plan to get an LED headlight and maybe LED signals front and rear but I'm not trying to spend $500 for a Daymaker. Any recommendations for really good LED headlights for a few hundred or less?",

Navigate to the clip you want to download, lets use [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/DullSuperChinchillaRitzMitz) as an example...2. Once you're there, right click anywhere on page and press on \"Inspect\" or press F12.3. When click that a window will pop up, you want to look for the \"Network\" tab... as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/oOhkT3k.png).4. Once you open the network tab, you'll see [this](https://imgur.com/a/j02CG73)... you want to look for the \"media\" tab within that window, as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/OMcn2UV.png).5. When you open the media tab, press F5 and wait until it fully refreshes... once it's done refreshing, you'll see [this](https://i.imgur.com/vIXylpH.png) pop up. (Make sure you're on the clip page before you press F5, the point is to make the video play after the refresh.)6. After that, right click on the first result and click \"Open in a new tab.\" As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/6KE1TXz). Doing that will open a new tab with a direct link to the video. Like [so](https://clips-media-assets2.twitch.tv/vod-260266991-offset-13400.mp4).7. After the page loads, there will be an arrow facing downwards on the bottom right of the video player control bar... just press that to download the clip. As you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/kPEBAtE.png).This is super easy to do if you follow the guide step by step. The best part about this is that it'll be impossible for twitch to fix unless they completely redo how they serve clips, which is not easy and not worth the effort for them.Hope this helped xo.",

		"text": "My wife (who was then my fiancé) was raped last year before we were married. She told me this just yesterday and I’ve been eaten up by a number of emotions. Here’s the story. My wife often works late, and works with 15 or so coworkers in the same capacity as her. One coworker who lives close to the workplace, had in the past invited coworkers in the past over for a few drinks together after a late shift. My wife tells me she had become friends with this guy in the first few months of her starting to work there. She didn’t suspect he was a creep, though she says he had made one strange comment to her one time. Anyways back to that night. She went over to the coworkers apartment expecting others to be coming as well. She told me that even if no one else came, she would have been comfortable since she thought she knew him well.    She had a glass of wine and that was the last thing she remembered until she woke up naked in his bed at 5 am. She quietly left and had vomit all over her shirt. She never spoke to the guy after this, and he moved away two months after that night. My wife went to the doctor two weeks after to make sure she was okay, she was on birth control already and didn’t have any STIs. To further complicate things, she doesn’t know if he drugged her wine or if her anxiety medication interacted with the alcohol ( which I’ve seen before in her to make her throw up and pass out). Either way she was not conscious when it happened. She did not tell the police or anyone else but a counselor. I am so mixed up I don’t know how to react. I have told her this was not her fault and I’m very sorry it’s happened to her. But I’m angry she didn’t tell me right away and I’ve been encouraging her to talk to the police. If this person still lived close by I think I would actually kill him I’m so mad. Just the thought of her being with another guy (even if she doesn’t remember it) makes my stomach turn. I haven’t been able to sleep from these mixed up emotions. We had been dating for 6 years before getting engaged (started a year after high school), and were both virgins. We were both the only ones each other had sex with, which saddens me deeply that this is no longer the case. I also feel dirty knowing we had sex regularly after the event (though not in the time before her doctor cleared her). How should I be feeling? I’m so confused. I’ve tried to ensure her that this wasn’t her fault. I just feel so lost. She says she didn’t want to tell me earlier because she didn’t want to lose me, but couldn’t hold it in any longer because of guilt. I’m worried that our relationship will no longer work out. I love her to death but would feel uncomfortable being intimate from now on (based on what I’ve pictured and can’t get out of my head) and don’t know how we could continue with this marriage. So I’m asking for help, what should I tell myself, how should I feel, etc?TL:DR - wife was raped by coworker a year ago and just told me now. I’m confused and don’t know how to feel. Help me. ",

Not only that, but there is slight inflation in currency.  $60 in 2007 (when I got Halo 3) is worth $69.82 today.  Us gamers don't like seeing price increases for AAA titles, so how do developers make more money to support more overhead?  DLC and Microtransactions.DLC and Microtransactions can just be money-grubbing shit-fests for the most part, and games like Destiny and many EA published games are great examples.  But you have to understand that many of the game developers just want to make a great game that everyone can enjoy.  Most of the shitty things about which gamers complain aren't the programers' and artists' faults.Now, games are still quite profitable, but games are getting more difficult to make as more doors are open to increase graphical fidelity, they are taking longer to make because the games become even larger in scale (and in size), which means that developers collect more paychecks as they develop the game.I hate microtransactions that are game-altering, but I understand why we get charged for DLC that gives us content that wasn't in the base-game.However, all of us can agree that on-disk (or in-code) content that is locked until you pay extra is total shit.  Fuck all that noise.If you don't agree with me, let's have a discussion in the comments!  I'm not excusing the abuse of such stuff, but I am trying to give developers the benefit of the doubt as things get more difficult and more expensive to produce for us gamers.",

During LTR was often tired but still pushed through and had good (but slowly declining in quality) sex. Two months post breakup, went full beta and tried to get her back and failed. Took me a month to get over it all but TRP made a huge difference, so thanks!Been working hard in the gym the last 2-3 months, killing it at work and had some really positive dates. Finally feeling like my SMV is increasing. However, all throughout this process, I've been feeling drained. I'll get 8 hours but wake up exhausted. I'll push through and hit the gym and go to work but get home and crash. My diet has been really good, maybe one cheat day a week if any. On top of this, last Friday night I went out on a date, ended up back at hers, fooled around, was hard as (I think) during foreplay but once we got to tbe bedroom, I just struggled. Was tired and in my head then lost all confidence and erection strength. Tried again next morning but same thing happened. This was breaking my drought so not sure if that's part of it.So, that brings me here to ask if anyone has had similar experiences or any advice on essentially how to fix myself. Could it be an underlying issue or something like low testosterone? Just found out my dad has had prostate issues so could that be part of it? Any advice would be very much appreciated.",

I don't have lead teaching experience and they want someone with more experience But on the other side of the coin, they saw both of those things on my resume and called me in.

I'm saving (almost at that coveted 4 figures!), and for the first time in years I am completely debt free. My monthly budget is broken down into broad categories, for example a lump sum just goes to a separate (joint with my girlfriend) account from which all bills are taken, and there's a buffer steadily building up in there.  We plan meals and only buy from the supermarket what we need (in fact my girlfriend and I have started a rule that says we can only buy things that are on the shopping list, even if we realise that we need something while we're at the shop). I give myself around £150-£200 per month of \"pocket money\" with which I can buy anything. I still keep track of exactly what I'm spending this on in a spreadsheet, to make sure I don't overspend.    I've just gone through and looked at my monthly pocket money spends, and there's a clear third of my money just going on random meals here and there; lunch at the office when I forgot to make a packed one; a takeaway because I didn't want to cook; MacDonalds after a gig; just the odd £5 - £10 here and there which quickly builds up to a substantial portion of my budget.    What tips and tricks do you have to curb this expenditure and keep a tighter hold on my pocket money?",

		"text": "We both made it clear that this isn't a friends with benefits relationship, we both hate those. First I'll tell you about him. He has been very honest so far. We always talk about how we are feeling and what our goals are. He is 27 and ready to settle down with someone. He keeps saying he is looking for the \"perfect\" girl, he is so focussed on finding her. He fears that he is getting older and running out of time. So I feel like he thinks that the next girlfriend he has, has to be the one. Which puts a lot of pressure on him and on me. He wants lots of kids, and he doesn't believe in divorce, so when he has a girlfriend, he is very serious about her and it has to be somebody who he can see a future with. He's been in two relationships, one for 2 years and another for 7 and he hates the idea of friends of benefits. I am the same, we share the same beliefs and future goals. I am also looking for somebody to settle with and grow with. The only difference between the two of us is that I am ususlly a \"go with the flow\" type of person (except for right now), and he is an overthinker. He has admitted he has stayed up until 4 AM thinking about \"us\". We have been seeing each other for exactly one month now. We have hung out about 8 times in total. We have had sex a few times and he has slept over once. We see each other about twice a week. We met on Tinder, which is not the best place to meet somebody you want to settle with, but somehow, we met each other and we are on the same page. His reason for being on Tinder was to find a nice girl, not somebody who just wants sex. My reason was to find a guy to date and not just have sex. He said it's the first time he met somebody like me, as soon as we met in person, he said \"you are too good for Tinder\".After only a couple dates, he had already talked about deleting Tinder. He said he was on it because he was looking for a nice girl, and he has found one (me), so he didn't see a need for it. In the beginning, we would text each other everyday. We still do, but some days we go without. Last week, he even told me that he thinks about me every morning. I initially felt like he was moving too quickly. He admitted that he was moving fast and that he was going to slow down.  It has been a month now, last night, he told me he still has Tinder and that he wanted me to know that. He said he has only talked to a couple girls and he hasn't met up with anybody since him and I met. It really sucked to hear that, but I guess it's not wrong. We aren't in an exclusive relationship. We both have the right to date as many people as we want until we say we are boyfriend/girlfriend. He said that he understands if this bothers me and if I don't want to hang out anymore he would understand, but he doesn't want to lose me and he still wants to see me. His actions show that he cares for me and likes me. He is constantly smothering me in kisses and holding me. We have a lot of meaningful conversations. He planned an amazing date last week. He took me to a spa, and we then went to a party afterwards. All his friends were there. So before the party, he asked me, \"what should I call you? Are you just a friend?\" I didn't know what to say in the moment, so I just said \"I don't know! What do you think?\" and he said he didn't know either. So we left it at that. He keeps saying he is trying to find the perfect girl and it's so hard. Maybe he isn't sure if it's me, maybe thats why he is still on the app, but then when he asks me \"what are we?\" it confuses the heck out of me. Maybe I just need to give it more time? It has only been a month. I keep telling him that. We still barely know each other. What does this situation seem like to you? Any advice on what I should do? Do you think its wrong that he is on TInder?The next time we hang out, I'm thinking of saying to him, \"So since you're still on tinder, does that mean it's ok for me to talk and hang out with other guys too, if I want?\" Just to see what he would say...TLDR: I met a guy on tinder who is searching for a girl to settle down with. I am also looking for somebody to settle with. We have been hanging out for a month, about 8 times in total. He seems like he really likes me by his actions and even his words. What worries me is that he is still on Tinder. He told me because he felt I should know. He said if I wanted to leave he would understand, but he didn't want to lose me and he doesn't want to hurt me. Do you think it's wrong that he is still on the app? What does this situation seem like to you? ",

I just think she would deserve someone committed, kind and off the franchise. The girls were all spilling tea except for her. When she was asked the interview questions, she paused for a while and answered calmly and very... Kendall-like (how she was on the ITMs on the show).2. Please make Seinne and Ben happen.

I think childbirth is highly immoral, equal to murder and rape in its severance. You force someone to exist, while they didn't exist they didn't suffer and need to be happy.No matter what you do, there's a victim. A cow dies so you could it. You had sex with that person, but someone had to get rejected and feel unwanted. Great art is built upon suffering - depressed authors like Hemingway/Carver, people going through dangerous life (Rappers like Big L) or maybe the artist is just a horrible criminal - like Lostprophets' singer. Every good thing I have in my life - all the books and plushies and machinery - someone is working in a factory in poor conditions for this. In the dating scene of my country, it's rape or be raped, reject or become trash. Guys lack empathy and harass. Girls treat guys like disposable plastic bags.Nothing is certain. Someone I love can die tomorrow. I can lose a leg, develop a disease, or realize everyone I love actually really hates me. I could lose all my money because of a glitch or a mistake.Isn't it logical to be depressed and pessimistic over this?_____&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I absolutely love this gig. It's a great way to make extra money during the holiday season. The reindeer are also super cute and super fun to learn about. One thing I don't like is the children. Especially children who don't listen. The same goes for their parents.Each reindeer is fully insured. However, we are not a petting zoo. We do not allow people to pet the reindeer, under any circumstances. We also have the reindeer behind 2 fences when we take them out (one is a 6 foot tall red metal fence that has gaps that the deer can stick their noses out of, and then 3 feet out is a white 3 feet tall plastic picket fence that we decorate) for safety, and as is regulated by the USDA. Take last night as an example. The reindeer wouldn't stop pestering each other in the pen (usually they just walk around and munch on the oats and hay we put in there, but the male lost one of his antlers so the female kept pestering him and he was paranoid and running in circles) so my husband sat in there with them to keep them separated. Some little girl would not accept no as an answer when he said she couldn't pet the reindeer. She said, \"well, you're allowed to!\" And he kept on saying (because we try to not kill the Christmas spirit) that he was allowed to because Santa appointed him as the official reindeer handler. She would not stop pestering my husband, who is in this pen trying to make sure that 2 400+ lb reindeer don't gore each other with their antlers in front of a large crowd. Like honey, just learn to accept that life isn't fair and you can't always pet the animals in pens. Do you want to get knocked in the head by a 10 lb antler? I have been backed into the corner of a stall by our large male (who is probably 600 lbs with antlers 3 feet wide) and that was absolutely terrifying. And I've been working with these wonderful animals for years. Some of them have been hand raised, sure, but they're still unpredictable.Ive lost track of the point of this post because I've had like 2 glasses of wine but I guess what I'm trying to say is that just because it's the holidays doesn't mean your kids get to be little shits around potentially dangerous animals. I don't even know why I'm ranting about it here. Peace, love, and reindeer. [Reindeer tax](http://imgur.com/a/Evks2)",

He said some mechanics might be able to fix the regulator but some can’t and need to do a new Alternator . We haven’t had any other issues with it and she only has $2000 left on the car to pay it off (so within this year ) . So is Alternator worth replacing?

The calorie companies are the true villains of this novel, so I expected Anderson to eventually turn against them - perhaps under Emiko's influence. I've got to applaud Bacigalupi for ignoring the usual \"hero's\" arc and giving us something more realistic.That said, I felt that the only part of the novel that really rang false (besides the lack of solar, wind and nuclear power... but that's the MacGuffin, I suppose) was the penultimate scene in which Anderson's plot is finally foiled by Kanya. This was the only place where I felt Bacigalupi reached into the sack of cliches to pull out an ending. There's something about the immaculately constructed double-cross (the construction of which is entirely hidden from the reader), impeccably executed, that just... wearies me.

Obviously I'm not going to try and make myself willingly sick, but what happens during a cold?Your body is focused on fighting it off and you take whatever measures you can in order to manage the symptoms. As a result of this, you're not going to be particularly on edge or ready to go from a physical standpoint. You're going to want to lay low and relax, and often times it's this motivation to relax that will facilitate one's ability to act in a productive manner.Similar to that, I've always had a tendency to be more motivated to get things down when it's late at night and I'm tired. In college, I would put sleep off in order to write papers and it worked spectacularly in that I got it done. And why? Because my body was in a state where it was craving to go into that relaxation mode, but I fought it off in order to tend to something that needed to get done. What's more, during night, no one's around, the world is asleep and it's nice to use that time to work with minimal interruption.And stating the obvious, this doesn't make me think that I need to be constantly pulling all nighters and willingly depriving myself of rest, but it's leading me to think that there's something to promoting physical relaxation that will help alleviate many of the hindering qualities of ADHD.**TL;DR:** Now more motivated than ever to stay on top of my relaxation practices to relax my body and enhance my ability to act in a constructive manner.",

Everyone there is great friends with each other and they do things outside of work together. I have intentionally tried to keep my personal life separate from work so all my social media is as private as I can make it and I haven't added anybody from work on Facebook or let them follow me on Instagram. I get along just fine with everyone while I'm at work and I work well in group settings.  On my annual review my manager marked me \"unsatisfactory\" in the \"teamwork\" category. Her reasoning was that since I don't eat with them, haven't added anybody on social media, and don't participate in group activities outside of work (for example, everyone went to a baseball game and I didn't go), I \"haven't shown a desire to really become part of the team\". Because of this, I was denied an annual raise. It's a private company, non Union. Is this legal? It seems like a ridiculous reason considering I work well with everyone and have done well completing tasks as part of team.

Anyway, I hate how there is not a specific timeline here. I just have a lot that I want to tell her which I realized sonce the relationship ended. I know it's frowned upon but I really do want to tell her all of this because I feel like it'll make me feel a lot better. Is there a best time to tell her or is it best to just give her space and then tell her if we ever do talk about getting back together? A lot of it is stuff I realized after the breakup of what I did wrong and just me pouring my heart out to her. Even though I think we might reconnect in the future and get back together, I'm not holding on to that hope. This stuff is just stuff that I want to say to her so she knows, even if it really does nothing right now or ever. I just need people who got back with exes succesfully to tell me their timelines or whatever might be the best course of action here.

But here's my issue: something I've noticed in the college scene (mostly freshman and sophmore's) is how much men are promoted and encouraged by both straight &amp; gay men (and even some women) to have sex, cheat on men/women, and act promiscuous. I can't tell you, as a man, how many times I've come across a straight guy (and some girls) who's asked me:1. If I'm still a virgin.2. If I would accept sex if a random man/woman asked me it.3. If I found this random man/woman hot.4. Ask for long discussions on how \"tight\" the sex was.5. If I would cheat on my \"ugly\" partner for a \"better catch\".For the last 4 of the responses, I either just tell them I have a gf (or bf if their gay) or just give a shallow \"Sure\", because in male culture, you are considered gay if you don't find a girl hot.

As much as three or four hours would be spent just edging, and I fully deluded myself into believing that, if I just managed to stay away from reaching 'O,' everything would be fine.Well as it turns out I was wrong. In every possible way I was wrong.I neglected flossing, something I promised myself I would do everyday. Figured after a porn binge \"screw it, what's one missed day?\" One day turned to two, then three, four, five, six, seven...you get the idea. Quit porn a couple of days ago took up flossing and what do you know? My gums were bleeding again.Now, obviously I could have just willed myself to floss after a porn binge but, man, I just didn't want to. And i guess that makes sense doesn't it? Spend so much time inducing bodily pleasure on yourself that, naturally, you want to continue maximizing that pleasure.Thing is, pain and pleasure go together, and the next day, I'd be so goddamn pissed off and irritable that I just couldn't manage to get through the day without feeling like I was going to explode out of anger. For that reason alone, I had to stop for my own mental health.So, it's clear now. Any sort of future sexual engagement will be done sans digital stimulation. I'm sure VR will be great, but honestly man, I just can't do it. As someone naturally prone to anxiety and being overwhelmed, it's just not something I can continue.Now that that's all set and done, I believe I've got some flossing to do.",

But it's becoming quickly apparent to me that the more I hang out with her, the more difficult it is to just view her as a friend. We went out last night with her friend (who seemed to like me so I gave a good first impression) and she got drunk and was kinda giving me what I thought to be IOIs (twirling her hair, biting her lip) but I just couldn't pull the trigger. Basically she became a huge flirt while drunk and we held hands in the cab on the way home. I really have no idea what to do here because while I don't mind being friends with her because I like her as a person, it's also hard to not think I'm being tested in a way and playing a long game for anything to happen (especially based on past experiences where I ended up hooking up with a few girls that I am friends with). Anyone have advice here aside from pursuing other girls? I already do that and don't put all my eggs in one basket. ",

I really do like her but I'm not looking to make the same mistake as my last girlfriend 3 years ago where I willingly neglected things in my life to spend time with her because I was young and had no idea what I wanted to do. I can't do that anymore now that I'm getting older and have more of a direction. I discussed this with her already and she is okay with it and understands, but I'm really just on the fence about it and regret moving so fast now. I'm considering just riding it out for a few more months until I get to know her better before making a decision.TL;DR: Moved fast with the girlfriend, now having second thoughts due to her baggage. Considering riding it out for a few months to see if it gets better and if these are just the new relationship jitters. Edit: What's with all the downvotes?

I spent a while looking for nice routes around the area and ended up with one called \"Wansfell Pike, Troutbeck, and Skelghyll Wood.\" It started in the really beautiful town of Ambleside (I am not from the UK and love looking at the old buildings) that had fourteen hiking gear stores (including one for kids) on our trek through the village.Neither of us are in top notch shape and this was a really nice walk with most of the climb (about 400m) in the start and then, after enjoying the lovely view from the windy peak, mostly descended until the circular walk ended.I found a site called https://www.walklakes.co.uk which focuses on paths around the Lake District and it looked really nice with the bogginess and ascent and all the description, not to mention the cute doggy in the pictures \^.\^ The hike we did was [walk 151](https://www.walklakes.co.uk/walk_151.html).",

I can't deal with the \"hate the sin, love the sinner\" religious types either. When I meet someone new and they ask if I have a (opposite sex) significant other do I just say no or yes or do I come out at that point. B/C while it's not really their business I don't want to feel like I'm ashamed of who I am plus straight people often talk freely not only about their s/o's. But also their (TMI) sex lives. So what does r/bisexual do in this situation? Do you stay closeted or not talk about it if you're single or dating someone of the opposite sex?",

		"text": "Brief history of the house- we built/purchased it together.  I paid the down payment and a large chunk of the home amount with the remainder of a trust fund I had.  At some point we refinanced and added $20,000 of debt to be rolled into the mortgage.  I think somehow I was left off of the paperwork for this, and I think it left the house in his name only.  I'm not sure.  Nothing changed with the HOA company, and both names are on that account.I left him due to abuse of our children and me.  I was and continue to be a stay at home mother; one of our kids is disabled.In the divorce decree, I am listed as being the recipient of the house.  By the time we actually arrived in court for our court date, XH was supposed to have filled out a special warranty deed assigning me full ownership of the home, and he was supposed to have contacted both our mortgage company and HOA to let them know that he was to be removed, and I was to be the contact person, seeing as I had been the one making payments, would be the sole owner/occupant, etc.I paid the mortgage and HOA fees and continued doing things the way I had been since the separation and since I'd taken over making all the payments myself, and this went along fine and I assumed everything was okay and handled.  However, I found out that he had never filled out or filed the warranty deed, and he had not contacted the HOA or the mortgage company.  When I called the mortgage company, they said that legally they cannot add me to the account without the deed, and that they can't talk to me at all and could not dating back to the date of refinance.  I contacted the HOA, which said that they needed a copy of the deed too.  I hired and paid for a lawyer to draft the documents, since my XH wasn't going to do it of his own volition.  I literally did all the work for him, all he had to do was sign.  He has looked for ways to \"make me pay\" for leaving him in so many ways.  He found a new one over the summer of 2017.  He contacted the post office and had them forward all mail having to do with the house to his new address.  They had been coming to me.  This is where it all started to go downhill.  Apparently I got a $50 fine for weeds in my flower bed, and I was sent a letter (with a cost per letter of $30) about the weeds.  But I didn't know, because he had made the change to mail regarding the house without my knowledge.  This initial $80 fine multiplied quickly with interest, and more letters at $30 each.  When I went to pay my fall assessments in October, I owed $600 (the HOA fee alone is simply $144 and I had that, however in no way did I have the $600+).  I contacted them and explained the situation and asked them to waive some of the fees and to take his name off the documents so that they wouldn't forward. They said they'd get back to me about the fees but they could not remove his name until he gives them the deed.Fast forward today, it is time to pay my January assessments.  I have not received any mail about the house since speaking with them in October, which is not unusual since I pay online and have not had any violations with my yard or anything, and again I thought it was resolved.  I logged in to pay my assessments and see that I now owe over $1300 and that it is mostly letter fees- letters that are still being forwarded to him and I am not receiving or have any knowledge of.  No fees were waived and I had no idea I was still receiving letters.  My XH sheepishly told me that he HAS been receiving the letters.  He said he will \"get around to\" filling out the deed paperwork.    I am on a tight budget, a very tight budget, and I can't afford to pay for his mistakes, or hire a lawyer to fix this for me.  I am at his mercy.  What are my options?",

I usually say something like:I first of all make sure that the children know the rules and have a say in coming up with them. They then sign their name, showing that they understand the rules. When a child breaks a rule, I remind them of the contract. I am respectful to all students and find that generally they treat me with respect in return, and because they know what I expect from them (the rules that we make together) and model what I want them to do, I rarely have any behavioral issues. I recently learned about conscious discipline and have been using those key words and ideas lately. It has to do with correcting children in a positive, nurturing way and making them feel comfortable and respected. However, I also like ideas from other forms of classroom management. For example, I really like many of Haim Ginott's principles as well, and I am willing to use whatever model works best for the school or for the children, but the most important thing for me is to model respect and good values so that the children have a better chance of doing the same in return.Any advice?

I know nothing about that stuff but apparently it's necessary and she was told to get it. One day I was running the water for the cat from the sink because he likes to drink from it. I didn't know the sink was clogged, and it overflowed. It then went through the floor into the ceiling below, leaving a large water stain. I don't think that would have happened if it was caulked but I don't know. I left the water running for about 10 minutes before turning it off and there was maybe a quarter inch of water on the floor.Anyway, it was an accident. I just found out that she got an estimate for that and it's apparently going to cost all of my $500 security deposit for her to fix it. I'm not sure if that's fair or if I should be annoyed. I feel like that shouldn't have happened if she had taken care of the floor, but she says it's not her fault since she didn't have the money to get the caulking. What do y'all think?

One of my main goals in life is to challenge my disadvantage and prove I can be just as successful as everyone else, but actual execution in this goal has led to mixed results.

I'm so happy she gets to be Julie. Nathan Gunn is really wonderful as well. This was my first time watching the show so I don't know of any other actors, but this cast was amazing. Jason Danieley as well, just wow. When The Children Are Asleep is such a fun and heartwarming song. I'm very happy that the show coming to Broadway *(although I do wish the imperial was still for you know, that other show)*I loved the music (gorgeous repetition of themes and often present in the background), I loved the story, I loved the ballet sequence. I get why it can be seen as problematic but it didn't feel like that to me. I'm curious to know how it will be received when it's on Broadway (idk if they're going to edit some of the lines? like ~~it's possible for someone to hit you and not hurt at all~~.) I'm a little sad that it was so good and now the first experience of it was a video, but it was utterly gorgeous and on the other side i'm happy because otherwise I had to wait at least a year or maybe not see it ever. Also, does Joshua Henry have a fitting voice for this? I haven't heard him sing anything like it but it seems so.. low and different than what he normally does? I hope he will be great though.

Like Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth clearly feels a bit of sadistic pleasure when he's torturing what he thinks are enemy combatants in disguise, but when he learns that they actually were innocent bystanders, then he feels angry enough about it to lash out, which wouldn't be what I'd expect from a cardboard villain. Similarly while Strickland was of course casually racist and sexist in Shape of Water, he felt like a realistic product of his time for it, and it was believable that he was disengaged from his loving family because he was in charge of highly sensitive operation involving something which had bitten part of him off, which would probably make me behave the same way if not worse. It's probably a result of the fact the villains are meant to represent the real world while the good guys represent something more whimsical and thus something with which it's harder to identify. ",

Then Olivia will tell me in detail what they did, what they talked about, how Jessica's dog loves her, etc. I always respond positively (e.g. \"I'm so glad you had a nice visit!\") and try not to let it bother me, but.... it does. Now, Jessica and I have had sleepovers for multiple nights in a row before and had dinner together many times, but we don't tell anyone else about it because we don't want anyone to feel excluded. I keep telling myself I shouldn't feel threatened. It doesn't bother me that Jessica has other friends, I think it's good! She needs all the support she can get. I just don't like that I'm letting Olivia's pettiness bother me and eat away at me and make me second guess my friendship with Jessica and wonder if she likes Olivia better than me.

		"text": "Hello and welcome to a very special episode of THEORYCRAFTING, where I will talk about things related to the sub because I found the BigQuery data so you have to deal with me.What is the BigQuery data? Well, BigQuery is a giant data source owned by Google. You can upload data in the form of database tables which you can query and do things with. In this case, some generous soul uploaded every Reddit comment from the past 4 years onto it. So that means that every comment from the sub is logged in these tables. So, this means that I can perform queries to figure out stuff about the sub! And because I love data, I will proceed to do that!1st query: Top usersI love ranking people, so who better to rank than the top 10 users from 2017? Here's how I did it: I took total comment karma for the posts over the past year, and aggregated it. Pretty simple. Karma per post is not a good measurement since there are certain users who have a low post count but very high comment karma for their scores, making them anomalies. Looking at raw total is better in my mind since it allows us to see our most prolific users and how they stack up. So, without further ado, here is the list:Row | subreddit | author | total_score | total_count | comment_rank  -----|------------|---------|--------------|--------------|-----------------1 | thebachelor | PrincessPlastilina | 138761 | 8278 | 1 2 | thebachelor | low-calcalzone_zone | 67475 | 4314 | 2 3 | thebachelor | honeyimsorry | 63335 | 1968 | 3 4 | thebachelor | QuesoChef | 58372 | 5900 | 4 5 | thebachelor | peace2speakforever | 49062 | 3499 | 5 6 | thebachelor | Jotz00 | 43008 | 2415 | 6 7 | thebachelor | mamaddict | 41333 | 3377 | 7 8 | thebachelor | camirose | 40063 | 2735 | 8 9 | thebachelor | Cherssssss | 31580 | 2096 | 9 10 | thebachelor | BoomJayKay | 30535 | 2059 | 10/u/PrincessPlastilina is so prolific that purely off her comments in this sub alone she made it into /r/CenturyClub. So congrats Princess. But let's look at the count here. 8278 comments means she's outputting around 22.6 comments per day, which is some pretty prolific output. The rest of the list are people you'd more or less expect to be our top commenters. For comparison, I have 24.5k karma from the sub on 1858 comments, Tex has 6547 karma on 351 comments, and Sscoutt has 17.5k karma on 1149 comments. So these really are the best of the best.Now here's the real fun part: calculating the tf-idf for the subreddit. The tf-idf is basically a calculation of how important a word is to a document in a collection. We can use it for things like information retrieval in search engines. This value increases proportionally to the number of times the word appears in the document and is offset by the frequency in the collection. So to put it another way: if a word is used a lot in a document (post/comment) the number goes up, but if it's used frequently enough, the number goes down. This helps offset the fact that some words are used so much that it would be meaningless if you included them (this, that, these, the, etc.). According to wikipedia, 83% of text-based reccommendation systems in digital libraries use this algorithm.So what are we gonna use it for? Well obviously the first thing we are going to do is figure out what our favorite phrases are from 2017. Maybe this will help shed some light on the state of the sub:Row | id | word | tf | docs_with_word | idf | tfidf  -----|----|-------|---|--------------------|----|------1 | t3_5xx4u8/delo60b | tanner's | 0.22857142857142856 | 4 | 7.062405833851046 | 1.6142641905945248 2 | t3_5xx4u8/delo60b | wedding | 0.22857142857142856 | 18 | 5.558328437074772 | 1.2704750713313764  3 | t3_5xx4u8/delo60b | jade | 0.22857142857142856 20 | 5.452967921416946 | 1.2463926677524448 4 | t3_5n5uej/dc90mjt | tanner's | 0.11940298507462686 | 4 | 7.062405833851046 | 0.8432723383702742 5 | t3_6u1gna/dlpacs0 | stock | 0.10256410256410256 | 2 | 7.755553014410991 | 0.7954413348113837 6 | t3_70519n/dn0loal | subreddit | 0.12121212121212122 | 7 | 6.502790045915623 | 0.7882169752624998 7 | t3_6w9w85/dm6f5jd | alexis | 0.14705882352941177 | 25 | 5.229824370102736 | 0.7690918191327553 8 | t3_5s55kf/ddcgygy | tanner's | 0.10810810810810811 | 4 | 7.062405833851046 | 0.7635033333893023 9 | t3_6qxmaz/dl0uhc7 | celebrity | 0.0967741935483871 | 2 | 7.755553014410991 | 0.7505373884913863 10 | t3_60i033/df6obj3 | like | 0.3333333333333333 | 515 | 2.204533294307201 | 0.7348444314357336 11 | t3_6fynqg/dim3gc8 | leggings | 0.09090909090909091 | 2 | 7.755553014410991 | 0.7050502740373629 12 | t3_5n5uej/dc90mjt | wedding | 0.11940298507462686 | 18 | 5.558328437074772 | 0.663681007411913 13 | t3_5n5uej/dc90mjt | jade | 0.11940298507462686 | 20 | 5.452967921416946 | 0.6511006473333667 14 | t3_6w9w85/dm6f5jd | boyfriend | 0.11764705882352941 | 23 | 5.313205979041787 | 0.6250830563578573 15 | t3_6n78z9/dk7cxzp | background | 0.0967741935483871 | 8 | 6.3692586532911015 | 0.6163798696733324 So in case you didn't know, we talked about Jade and Tanner's wedding a bunch. Did you know that Jade and Tanner got married? Did you know that Nick slept with Liz at Jade and Tanner's wedding? I did not know that. This was news to me. Also, the sub loves Peter. His name showed up in 141 posts, the most out of any contestant. Here's some other cool things we like to talk about:* Fuccbois: \"stock\", \"ship\", \"number\", \"player\", \"girls\", \"disliking\", \"crush\", \"cast\", and \"dumped\" all came in the top 60. This means that we can reasonably infer that we love to talk about fuccbois on this sub (expecially Rubby and Daniel, who show up in the top 100). Fun fact: \"rubby\" places at 131, while \"robby\" places at 76. If I had to guess for the 2018 data, Rubby's nickname might actually eclipse his real name in terms of popularity. * Nick's girls (but not necessarily Nick himself): \"alexis\", \"corinne\", \"leah\", \"dallas\", \"turtleneck\", \"scallops\", and \"cringeworthy\" show up in the top 100 words. We love dishing on Alexis and Corinne. However when it comes to the actual leads, we don't drop their names that much.* Negativity: \"player\", \"avoided\", \"disliking\", \"stressed\", \"sloppy\", \"cringeworthy\", \"cancelled\", \"hatred\", \"liar\", and \"anger\" all show up in the top 100 words.  Positive adjectives?  \"like\" \"beautiful\", \"attractive\", and \"cute\". Those are the only four that show up in the top 200. This sub objectively loves to complain. Which isn't bad. But just saying.* General thirst: \"tinobordy\" and \"peter\" show up in the top 100. We all know why. * Bryan's cheeks: \"cheeks\" comes in at 24, while \"bryan\" comes in at 116. His cheeks are more popular than he is.Flair counts: Here are the top 10 flairs for the past year:* Team I Disgust Her* Team Gap Teeth* Team Move Bitches* Team Copper* Team Chaos* Team Sscoutt* Team Jorge the Bartender* Team Deanie Baby* Team Mimosas and Bathrobes* Team Adam JrThere are probably other uses for this data that I haven't thought of yet. I only get so many queries per day on the free account, so I could conceivably test more and find other cool things. But I just thought that it would be cool to bring back Theorycrafting for a day and show you that at the end of the day, we really only care about trashing Nick's girls and the fuccbois they're dating.If you want to find all of this data, it's all in bigquery. Just search for \"reddit bigquery data\" and you'll be able to see it all.",

You do have pockets of 'peckerwood' types, and I remember all the disgruntled old white folks who spent much of their free time writing indignant letters to the editor of the Daily News (seems to be less of that nowadays), but that aside, everyone my age and younger came in every color of the rainbow and everyone got along in perfect harmony.  Also, the neighborhood of Winnetka is the most ethnically diverse neighborhood on the entire *planet*, last I heard.- Seattle.  Lots of white people--lots of *very* white people, it's like a refuge for gingers--but race seemed not to even be a *thing* up there.  I've spent maybe a total of a couple weeks up yonder, so maybe there was a lot I missed.  Also, I had the impression that if you left town and went out into them there woods, it might be a different story.- There's also San Francisco, at least before it got taken over by techies with money.  Back in the 90s it was every color of the rainbow and by the end of the 1990s, being a Nazi skinhead = instant ass-beating on sight.  (The SF Hells Angels actually ran them out of town!)

She had a boyfriend at the time We ended up sleeping together even while they were dating. We had excellent chemistry, and had sex very often, in our dorm beds. We also kissed a lot and I still remember her kisses. We travelled and went to raves often and I remember having sex with her in hotel rooms. I moved in with her for the year, and slept with her in her dorm, in her bed. I still remember us in bed, with our arms around each other, even if we weren’t kissing or having sex.She and I broke up a quarter way  through her grad school due to long distance.. For a while, she moved in with me in my dorm. I spent weekends with her and often bunked school to drive and stay with her and spent many nights at her place, since the drives were long. She moved on very quickly and dated other guys after me. She got a job, did her masters, date/hook up with a few guys, had a few boyfriends and met her current husband, and had a few kids with him.  They married very quickly. I learned from her work ethic, and admire how smart and beautiful she is. She will also start her PhD soon. I looked through photos and saw photos of us. I started feeling bad about not being with her, and I still really miss her.I got drunk with my fraternity brothers to get over her but I just ended up texting her and we agreed to meet up on Wednesday. I miss playing video games with her and spending time with her and she and I exchanged our PSN/Xbox Live/Steam and even our Nintendo Network IDs. I had so much fun playing Mario Kart, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Halo, GTA, Smash Bros, and even Fortnite after so many years. We played online and that brought us back to college.She made many big differences in my life. She helped me grow. She exposed me to travel and raves and we traveled frequently in breaks or went to the city in weekends.Also, I met my female best friend thanks to her! She also encouraged me to join my fraternity as well and I’m glad I made that decision! I also got a fast food job and may even get an internship for my business major! I used to be a computer science major and I briefly had an internship, which she inspired me to apply for and helped me get the confidence for my interview. I got the fast food job thanks to meeting a guy my ex slept with. I thought she would end up dating him but they didn’t, though he’s a cool guy. her husband may let me intern if there’s a spot at his company over the summer!She helped me be confident to ask out my second (and latest) ex girlfriend who I broke up with recently due to her being abusive. She also helped me feel less insecure about her past since I had 0 girlfriends before her, and she had 2 boyfriends in college and 1 boyfriend in high school before me. She also learned from our relationship and had a few boyfriends in grad school and met her current husband and has a few kids with him.What is worse, is that I still have photos of us on social media, and she has photos of me too. I still look at them and remember our time together. TL;DR: I miss my ex who is married and has kids. What should I do? How do I get over her?",

(I know it’s different for everyone but I just want an estimate)2. Were they able to get all the hair in one session, or did you need to come in a few times in order to do the whole area once? For example, we’re they able to do the whole face in one session, or did you have to go in to do one cheek, another session for the other cheek, and another session for upper lip, and so on?3. If you had to come in for multiple sessions in order to do the whole area once, were the appointments close together?4. How long do you have to let the hair grow out for prior to the sessions?5. Can you shave in between sessions?6. In regards to facial hair, if you couldn’t shave prior to the first session for a long time, how do you hide the hair?7.

I’ve put on some weight recently and the problem has reached a new level.Let’s start with the fact that I’m not that well-endowed. As everyone knows, obese guys lose length on top of their natural endowment. So my issue is with urination. Lately, I’ve not been able to urinate (either standing at urinal or sitting down) without making a noticeable mess. This isn’t so much an issue when I’m at home, as I can immediately clean up in a variety of ways. But I’m starting to become self-conscious about this at work or elsewhere in public. When using a urinal, I’m basically nearly incapable of not getting *some* urine on my pants. If I’m doing it quickly it can do a lot of damage before I even realize it. If I’m very careful, I still seem to get a few droplets at a minimum on my pants, always right around the crotch - so it’s painfully obvious what has happened.I don’t want to get into too many specifics about what the acute cause is, but it relates to a lack of vision and aim when urinating- as well as not having the length or access to aim properly. I know some guys who can just pee without ever touching anything and not make a mess as all. I envy them. I really don’t know of any invention or method that could resolve my issue, but I’m hoping there’s someone out there who has either experienced this or knows someone who has that can offer a solution. Thanks!",

As usual, please use the book's tag - [Lot49] - in the title of any discussion post regarding the book. From Amazon: &gt; The Crying of Lot 49 is Thomas Pynchon's classic satire of modern America, about Oedipa Maas, a woman who finds herself enmeshed in what would appear to be an international conspiracy.&gt; When her ex-lover, wealthy real-estate tycoon Pierce Inverarity, dies and designates her the coexecutor of his estate, California housewife Oedipa Maas is thrust into a paranoid mystery of metaphors, symbols, and the United States Postal Service. Traveling across Southern California, she meets some extremely interesting characters, and attains a not inconsiderable amount of self-knowledge.Enjoy!",

		"text": "Lately I went hard-mode on NoFap (no peeking/edging) + increased my meditation sessions from 10 minutes to 20-30 minute sessions.The effect so far, has been profound. Ever since I have made this change I *feel almost zero social anxiety* - not even that subtle anxious feeling in my chest. Previously, I wouldn't fap but I'd still peek at videos every day and edge quite a bit, and my meditation sessions were only short, but the effects were not enough for any serious change: I still had approach anxiety and dwelled on irrational shit, ever since this change I feel *no approach anxiety* whatsoever and have more of an IDGAF attitude. Girls approach me more now.I don't know why this has happened, maybe it's a placebo but I seriously doubt it. I think there's something going on here, because the confidence I am getting now isn't just ''Do the things you fear'' - it's almost as if *I fear nothing* (well, atleast things that scared me before, e.g. approaching a girl in the club and escalating).Case in point, yesterday some girls rejected me harshly at the club, but I truly didn't give a fuck and just carried on throughout the night.Maybe it might work for your or it won't, but I'd advise looking into mindfulness and going on NoFap (no peeking/edging, sex is okay though).**Meditation tips**- No music. Sit with back upright/straight on the floor- Whenever you catch yourself in a thought, realize it and say ''My mind was just lost in a thought'' and continue focusing on stillness- The aim of meditation is to focus on nothing, to have an empty 'still' mind. To achieve this feeling, ask yourself ''What is my next thought?'' and there'll be a several second moment where there is nothing in your mind, **this is stillness, and it grounds you in the present moment**. Once you get that gap, breathe in and out through your nose deeply and slowly. Eventually that stillness will become longer the more you meditate - Recognize your negative thoughts, but act as an observer to them. This is good for realizing how irrational they are, journalling them is also good- Use mantra's. I often repeat to myself things like ''I love myself. I have improved myself and will continue to do so'' and it begins to embed itself in my thoughts",

		"text": "My tablet model: Lenovo ThinkPad 8 (base specs: Intel Atom z3770, 2GB RAM, full HD resolution touchscreen - 1920 x 1200) Current system settings: Windows 8.1 with Bing, still as close to factory default as possible; no changes in Control Panels, automatic updates disabled, plugged in and charging, Bluetooth enabled and connected with Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard, wi-fi enabled and connected to home network. Something to note: Connected a Bluetooth keyboard. Game title: The House of the Dead: Overkill Initial settings:- Resolution: 1280x720- Windowed mode: off- Anti-aliasing: off My impressions: This is probably the first \"demanding\" game that I attempted on my TP8, and under the default settings, it was generally playable. The point of this game is to basically type zombies into submission; you see a zombie, and a text box, and you need to type out what that text box says in order to kill it off. No idea whether it's the Bluetooth, or whether it's the Atom or both, but there was always a split second lag between me typing and the game acknowledging the text. This may or may not be an issue later on when there are much longer text boxes, and I need to hunt down a micro USB 3.0 (M) - USB A (F) converter if I want to confirm the possibility of Bluetooth lag. I then downgraded the resolution to 960x540 and the framerate improved noticeably. Also, maybe I just don't have the best eyesight, but the graphics didn't seem any worse or less detailed for the wear. However, the input lag still existed. I don't have a computer powerful enough to run this game on best settings at the moment, so I can only conjecture that it's Bluetooth. Either that, or the game is resource-heavy enough that it affects typing speeds. This game has another mode: House of the Dead: Overkill. It's the same game, but instead of typing the zombies into submission, you shoot their heads off. It's not FPS, bur rail shooter instead, and you control the cursor with the mouse. Problem is, this game was absolutely unplayable on my ThinkPad. The cursor would move around with my finger, and if I tap on one part of the screen, the cursor would move there, but no matter how many times I tapped, it wouldn't fire; the left click would not register at all. I don't have a Micro USB 3.0 type-b-&gt;USB A plug converter around so that I can test it out with a standard USB mouse, so that will have to wait a bit. Best settings for optimal gameplay (IMO):- Resolution: 960x540- Windowed mode: off- Anti-aliasing: off",

I've had a handful of serious relationships in the past, most of which had a sexual component.  But they were all with people with more sexual experience than I had, and to varying degrees I felt swept along (and in some cases, coerced).  It was a very tumultuous, mixed bag.Regardless, I like sex in theory, and I am sexually attracted to people I'm romantically attached to.  I am now (two years and counting) in a relationship with a (presumably but not definitely allosexual) woman who had no sexual experience prior to being with me, and we're both at this point rather frustrated because it's clear we have difficulty connecting sexually - we both want it, but there is more often than not a disconnect in initiation.  I can be the aggressor, easily, and she's explicitly told me that I shouldn't worry that I'm being *too* aggressive when it comes to initiating sex (which I'd previously worried about).But I need more than that abstract reassurance.  I'm finding that if I reach out and I don't feel anything back from her, my interest dies.  We just had a three-week visit (we're long-distance and only see each other every 4-6 months) in which we had sex once, and not for lack of interest in it on either of our parts.  I just... don't know what to do.  We've talked about the difficulty; if nothing else our general communication is wonderful.  I think I'm mostly looking for validation, with respect to that difficulty sparking and maintaining interest without a feedback loop to sustain it, but any advice or experience you guys have to share would also be very welcome.

Here are some thoughts, in no specific order1. more action, less time introducing characters: I'd prefer an R rated movie with some focus on creating an action franchise. you have a bunch of people the audience should feel no pity for. you can make an absolutely psychotic action movie when you know half the characters are bonkers and very expendable2. The squad should be made of people that primarily dont have explosively powerful super powers. make it more human and more a text book action flick. Push is pretty good in this regard.3. Volunteers as Squad members: Rather than blackmail convicts into being in the squad, make an offer to death row or life term inmates to reduce sentences. Make them more genuinely self motivated to finish the task. Maybe that would create a fun competitive thing between squad members too - see who can pull of the craziest shit- kinda gig.4. make the plot more realistic: make it about overthrowing a democratically elected government to make way for a authoritarian puppet in a third world country. or hit a highly secure military base in a rogue nation and destroy/steal their nuclear technology. or destroy local and a much loved paramilitary force, or help a dictator quash rebellion. doesnt need to be a one movie sorta thing. basically something that sounds illegal as fuck. and something that shows that the squad members are just criminals enticed by a deal.5. ~~all or~~ most of the members die by the end of the movie. so you can keep introducing new rogues6. Squad fail their task. but the project itself is seen as a success by the government handler. so they try it again. the sequel will have a mix of veteran and newbies that can add to the plotwhat do you think?",

I experience dysphoria about pretty much all my primary and secondary sexual characteristics. The worst is the ability to become pregnant - it's always felt horribly wrong/ill-configured that my body could physically conceive and gestate a fetus inside of me, or ultimately create *another person* using my own body. I've always felt my body shouldn't be able to do that - my body shouldn't be configured in a way where this is possible.Anyway, I can't stand to think of myself as \"fertile\" or as having the ability to get pregnant. I go to lengths not to think about it. I don't want to think of myself like that.But sometimes I hear inclusive language such as \"people who can get pregnant\" instead of \"women\". It's good to include trans men and dfab nonbinary people, of course. I'm very sympathetic to this. Ironically, though, it makes me feel much worse than if I'd been misgendered as a woman. I know they are including me in the category of \"people who can get pregnant\" without gendering me, which *should* be nice, however, it only serves to remind me that I can get pregnant (ugh, I could barely type that) and thus it has the opposite effect. At least if they call me a woman, I can distance myself from it mentally. I'd rather be misgendered than have my attention drawn to a major source of dysphoria (the ability to get pregnant).So I'm just curious if anyone can relate, at all, to some aspect of what I'm saying?",

Daniel was a Jewish guy who got kidnapped when those Babylonians sacked Jerusalem. If any of you remember your world history, this happened a couple times. Daniel was hot and intelligent and he could interpret dreams and shit so he became pretty popular in the king's court. It was King Darius this time. He had lots of dreams and Daniel always interpreted them, saving him and the kingdom from impending doom a couple times. However, idk if you know this, but not everyone was keen on the Jews back in the day. So when Daniel gets all sorts of promotions and titles and shit, his political rivals are like \"fuck this, we gotta do something about this uppity kid who thinks he's all Godly and shit. Let's trick the King into killing him.\" This tends to be a theme in the Old Testament. So these guys (the King's other advisors) they were like \"you know Your Highness, we think it's really messed that people worship gods but don't worship you. You should pass a decree that people are only allowed to worship you, and anyone who worships any other God should be put to death somehow. Some lions, maybe. Idk.\"King Darius the Mede thinks this is a swell idea. Who doesn't want to be worshiped like a god. Except Daniel was like \"lol no\" and continued to pray to the God of Israel, because he's a good Jew. Plus it was God giving him all those dream interpretations, that's job security. Daniel's political rivals totally throw Daniel under the bus and the King is heartbroken. But of course, he can't disobey his own laws. So he throws Daniel in a den with some lions in it and tells him basically \"I hope your God is real my man cause u bout to get eaten to death by these lions i conveniently had in this den\". King Darius comes back in the morning and *surprise* Daniel is alive. No lions even nibbled on him. When the King asked Daniel \"wtf?\", Daniel told him that the God of Israel sent some angels to muzzle the lions. Everyone was a-ok.Except for Daniel's conspirators because King Darius had them thrown to the lions instead. Also their wives and children. The Old Testament is no joke.",

I've taken them in and done some work and playtesting and like what I have so far. it's definitely tweaked for my meta, which can be a bit relentless at times with some very strong decks (Sudo elf tribal Selvala, upgraded Feldon w/artifacts, Damia, a very strong Prossh) so there's not a lot of wiggle room. Still, a lot of your suggestions helped, as have my own additions. Here's what I've learned over 3 games:Magma Phoenix is a great card to have around. This deck struggles in the late game due to limited card draw (I might add in Steam Augury or just straight up Jace's Ingenuity), but having a flying blocker who can do at least 6 damage to a flier and kill off the smaller chumps (aka utility creatures) is benefitial, and being able to recur is just great. I had gained a lot of life off an opponents' Wurmcoil Engine so I could spare it.Haste- is great. Lightning Greaves have been great, and I have actually paid 7 mana to steal an opponents' Swiftfoot Boots which was totally worth it. I'm not sure if I should add my own copy or just work off of everyone else's. I'd also love to add Maelstrom Wanderer to this deck- I should be able to pull off the mana, and getting 3 cards for the price of 1 would help a deck like this a lot. Artifact Hate- this is a removal-heavy deck, and I think i need to go for as many x-for-1s as possible. I wanted to draw Merciless Eviction so many times last night. I want to add Austere Command and either Creeping Corrosion or Bane of Progress- not sure which. Thada Adel- this card is great in the early game, and good in general, but without haste or additional card draw, drawing it in the late game is painful. I wouldn't mind cutting it but it does what it does so well. Daxos of Meletis is in a similar situation, though a little better due to the life gain.Graveyard stuff- I want to play others' spells, and one of the easiest and most beneficial ways to do this is graveyard shennanigans. It's very effective, but I fear it's taking away from what else the deck wnats to do. Plus I have a few other decks that do this, so it's not really necessary. Still, when I'm playing such efficient creatures it's hard to resist at least an Animate Dead. I've been tempted to add Diabolic Servitude and Havengul LichHere's the deck, if anyone wants to check it out. It's a lot of fun when you have stuff to play. It can be reactionary or aggressive in the early and late games depending on what you draw. But I'd love to be able to draw more cards.

The problem is that the last receipt I have for the garnishment is dated 7/28/2015. This means I have already overpaid the balance due because they are not keeping accurate records. As of 12/30/2014 I had a balance left due of $1320.08. To date I have paid $1352.10. I honestly thought once the balance was paid off, the garnishment would cease but it appears they're going to be collecting until October at this rate?Who can I speak to regarding this at the sheriffs?

What kinds of inexpensive things would put a smile on your faces when you open them?I am a 21F university student, living on a very *student* budget, and my mother's best friend (30sF) is getting married in a few months. My mom is the maid of honour. My mom has told me that my long-term BF and I are going to be invited (invites haven't gone out yet), but even if we aren't, I understand that you can't invite everybody, and I would like to send her &amp; her new husband a gift. I absolutely love my mom's friend, she's the sweetest woman ever, and her fiancé seems great. My parents are helping with all of the wedding DIY and probably buying a big expensive registry gift but unfortunately, since I live 7+ hours away and am a broke university student, I can't afford to buy a registry gift, or help my MOH mom do the DIY stuff to compensate. But I really want to give them something that will make them smile, especially if they're unable to invite us and we won't be there to wish them well on their wedding day, because this is her second wedding and her first one apparently wasn't that joyful (mean ex).My mom's friend and her fiancé both love comic books, superheros, and other \"nerd\" stuff. They go to comic-con every year with my mom. My mom's friend is quite crafty, she loves doing all kinds of DIY crafts like cardmaking (her birthday cards are killer). But the superhero thing is their biggest shared interest. I was thinking of making them a framed cross-stitch of them in superhero masks + their wedding gown/tux, with their wedding date at the bottom, or something similar, but wanted to buy them something small too. I know the rule is typically \"gift price = price of feeding guest\" but my bf and I can only afford about $50 together, and that's pushing it.What kinds of smaller, inexpensive gifts would be appropriate? Have any of you guys received, or known people who have received, amazing but inexpensive wedding gifts that might not show up on those Buzzfeed \"affordable wedding gift\" lists? What small things would you as brides-to-be appreciate to get that people buying large expensive registry items might not bother with? I'm only 21 and haven't been to a wedding as a ~proper adult~ yet, so I'm sorry for my ignorance!I apologize if this was not the correct place to ask this question -- I know you guys are all so busy. Thank you so much for your help, and I hope you all have fantastic wedding days (and marriages, haha)!",

It's a very disruptable combo, I'm not running extra turns, and could only pull it off in one turn in very limited scenarios. I don't feel bad about the win, but I was hoping my playgroup would enjoy it more than they did, especially game 2 when they knew what it was and could respond. This was supposed to be my \"fun deck\" as it's psudo friendly and has other incredibly fragile wincons as well. I've won with Lab Maniac before which was met with a lot of excitement, but I guess a 7 mana sorcery is too easy. It's similar to an infinite combo, I guess.Needless to say I was disappointed.

I was reading query in AskWomen subreddit called \"Women of Reddit who waited until marriage to have sex.... how do you feel about your decision looking back on it?\" I love the idea of waiting for marriage for many of the reasons written in that query... it is beautiful to imagine my future husband as my one and only sexual partner and vice versa... that we are the only people to have ever seen and felt each other in that way. I like idea about exploring sexuality together. I also liked,&gt; \"It was really special having the first time be with a man that had made that important commitment to me already. Falling asleep next to him with OUR last name in OUR room after making love made us feel really secure and connected.\"&gt; \"Best decision ever to wait until our wedding night. I remember every moment, every touch, every feeling, all the emotions just like it was yesterday (even though it was 6 years ago). The love and trust we had for eachother made everything truely magical.\"(I hope its ok to use direct quotes because i'm complimenting their writing, its ver beautiful!)Other reasons do not appeal to me... like knowing he loves me for me instead of loving just the sex- I can intuit if someone loves me. I can also intuit if someone respects me or not- so I do not need to wait for marriage to tell if he really respects me as a person- *respecting me* would show me that he really respected me as a person- abstinence isn't enough to show me that.Most people dont want to wait for marriage and thats fine, this is just about me**But I have a concern.** Many user said they waited until marriage to avoid pregnancy. This leads me to believe that people who are waiting for marriage do not believe in using birth control to prevent pregnancy and would be ok with a post marital pregnancy.I am childfree. I believe in using birth control and **any pregnancy, pre or post marital, is unacceptable.** Prevention should be attempted as close to 100% as possible using multiple methods and I am pro choice for the remaining fraction. (Before someone tells me I'll change my mind- please assume, for the purposes of this question, that I won't.)Sadly I have not been able to find even one childfree person also waiting for marriage other than myself- either via internet or through my real life circles. **There seem to be an conflict between the conservatism of waiting for marriage and the liberalism of being childfree. not many people overlap in both.**Does anybody here have tips on how to date as a childfree person waiting for marriage?",

It seems to me in my experience I haven't seen many people start at a place like that and move on to bigger publications. Do many of the reporters at these small local papers like I described end up spending their career at similar-sized publications covering stories of similar scope, or is it common for them to move on to big city newspapers in today's day and age?I know the formula used to go--start at a small paper, move on to a bigger one and a bigger one from there etc. But does that really exist anymore?",

I don't want to go to aeronautical, as that's too specific if pilots become obsolete in the future. Despite my bad math grade, I do have some qualifications...* My physics grade (as of now) has held in A+ territory the entire semester (this confuses the hell out of me and my guidance counselor, as I just assume its because its easier to visualize). * In addition, I've gotten decent grades (High B-Low A) in regards to a few engineering classes I've taken (these include Design/Drawing for production, as well as Introduction to Engineering and Design).* Perhaps most importantly, I took an Aerospace Engineering course Sophomore year from (I think) the University of Iowa, and was able to get 92% for my yearly average. I didn't enjoy the math part, I was much more interested in the flight sim/designing and building our own gliders and rockets from scratch. Still, overall a very fun course. * Including my horrible math grade, my GPA comes out to about a 3.6-3.7 on a 4.0 scale. I do extracurriculars like sports, but I don't think its necessary to mention that. With this in mind, do you guys think I can get into a good department for Aerospace at a good college?

It looks like there's a spectrum but in reality, live rounds that aren't 12.7 penetrate everything except armor and helmets, and 12.7 penetrates everything scripted to be penetrable.

Yes I'm stupid for getting caught but the whole discussion was basically me trying to tell them it could be much worse and I'm not a drug addict.

I know he had his grace extracted and things like that but I feel like that doesn't justify all the super nerfing they did to this man, he should easily be able to destroy Asmodeous, his weakest creation.",

A camera breaks and four friends drink, in four interwoven narratives spanning seven centuries: a warped fairy tale about two sisters, a treehouse astronomer and a lazy evil bear; a retelling of Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\"; a purgatorial intermezzo about Scheherazade; and a contemporary fable about a subway murder. Murder ballads, doo-wop, jazz noise, and raucous campfire drinking songs collide in this surreal chamber musical from Dave Malloy, composer of Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812. Featuring Comet stars Brittain Ashford and Gelsey Bell, cellist Brent Arnold, designer Christopher Bowser, and director Annie Tippe.__________________________TICKET PRICES:Cushions on the floor, close to the action! $30General Admission seats when the house opens. $60Reserved seating.

		"text": "With the announcement of Stargate Origins, this subreddit has practically split right down the middle by two groups who are too short-sighted and close-minded.On one side, you have the users who claim to be speaking for every Stargate fan and that Origins is a failure already. These users are trashing the idea of a new series before they even see what it is, basing their assumptions on vague information.Assumptions include:* No one wants to see backstories of characters we've grown to care about.* That no one cares about certain characters.* That SGO will be locked behind a subscription.* That MGM does not need to gauge interest because fans don't change over the course of six to ten years.On the other side, you have the users trying to encourage everyone else to blindly support Origins without knowing what it is, solely to keep Stargate going. This is just as bad as the previous point of view. Blindly accepting Origins in whatever form it is delivered will only lead to a much poorer result, overall.These two camps need to get out of the mindset that there is only their point of view. There is a third point of view that very few people seem to be considering or even accepting, which makes sense from a monetary point of view, as well as from the need for MGM to gauge interest in Stargate while also figuring out what demographics to design future content for.Fans need to remain neutral to Origins. They must realize that coupled with the new Stargate Command website, it will allow viewers to actively offer input based on what they watch. The kind of information MGM is going to need is wide and varied and we need to be prepared to offer constructive criticism regarding what we see.Some things to consider are:* Was the show overly dramatic or too comedic?* Did the episode focus too much on a singular message? (Sexism, Racism, Xenophobia, etc.)* Was the score for the episode a good choice? (Custom composed music, licensed music, no music, etc.)* How was the pacing of the episode? (Too fast, too slow, etc.)* Were characters believable or likable?* How was the ratio of action to dialogue? (Too much talking, not enough gunplay, too much techno-babble, etc.)* How was the film style? (Too much shaky-cam, weird angles, etc.)* How was the actual storyline for the episode?The above, along with a myriad of other information, is what is currently important to the success of the franchise.They don't need to know that you would prefer more SG1, Atlantis or Universe. They need to figure out what sort of thematic style will be the most beneficial for them to focus on for long term success of the franchise. They don't need to hear how much Origins sucks or how great it is. Coming off as a ranting or raving fan means little to them at the moment.So, can we please stop acting like there are only two ways to view this announcement: Being either \"For\" or \"Against\" this miniseries?",

		"text": "I'm just realizing how poorly I fit in with my mothers family. I also posted this to socialskills.I'll try to not give away too much information. On that side of the family I'm a late in life mistake in a large Catholic family full of teenage accidents. Most of my cousins are more than seven years older than I am. Most people didn't know how to talk to a small child, or least keep up conversation. Only two are around my age and they grew up miles away and I rarely saw them. They were both boys (one of whom is also the family golden child) and usually excluded me from games that \"girls couldn't play\". As such my time spent among my mothers family was mostly spent reading books, or playing by myself and waiting to go home. That pattern has continued into my adulthood. I rarely looked forward to seeing any of them. I find most of them mean, and rarely have anything to discuss with them. Even the food is shit.There is one aunt (Trina) whom I feel close to, however she became very involved in a church and in the last few years she was taken a hard right ideologically, so we have less to talk about. Trina never had children (I was told by a nasty cousin that this wasn't by choice but by infertility) and I think she thinks of her and I as \"the smart, competent ones\". She's the only one who called me when I went away to college, and the only one to whom \"is your mom there?\" isn't the most used phrase of conversation.Also of note, my mother gets little to no respect from her siblings. They seem to see her as a child and tend to order her around and belittle her (I admit to using this to my advantage. When I worry about her health and want her to see a doctor I pass the message onto Trina who then talks her into getting medical help). They seem to like my father somewhat. He's a functional alcoholic (I think moms dad might have been as well) and usually just drinks \"with the men\" at family gatherings. I think they see him as an annoying little brother.Anyway, what brings me back round to this, one of my moms brothers (not one I'm fond of) came for a visit last week. He and my mom were discussing family news and gossip. I sat around and listened to my mom give details that I was never party to. For example, the health of her siblings, recounting a funeral for a distant relative that I was out of town for (I was told it went \"fine\", apparently there was some drama between she and her cousins), or their opinion on a relative I dislike and have always been told I'm crazy for disliking.This visit is making me realize just how disconnected I am from her family. My mom never talks about much of anything with me (\"everyone's fine, no real news...\") I've never felt loved or warmed, but now I realize I'm not one of them. I'm of two minds, part of me would love to be in a family and wished I belonged. Another part of me thinks \"well screw those insular rednecks\". Perhaps I'm being too harsh on them. I'm realizing that if something happens to my parents, I won't really have anyone on that side to talk to and feel like family with. At his point in my life (mid 20's) is there anyway to try and belong in my mothers family?   **tl;dr**: From a young age I never had much to say to my mothers family. As an adult I never picked up the skills to converse with them or enjoy their company. I wouldn't mind being part of a family, is it too late?",

I first noticed it in Book One with Ganoes and Tattersail, these two have NO connection, none at all there's barely a couple of pages devoted to their meeting before they've fucked AND become soulmates destined for one another. That's it, no back and forth, no development, nothing. The same with Crokus and Apsalar though you could put it down to young lust on Crokus' part but lust doesn't make you leave your home you've had for your whole life to go help a girl you've interacted with for barely three days. It's insanity, and I was hoping this wouldn't continue into the next book but I was sadly disappointed. Erickson has fallen into the most common trap among authors writing romance, the \"whenever two characters from the opposite gender meet their's gonna be a romance\" trap. It happens again in the Deadhouse Gates with Kalam and Minala....this woman HAS NO REASON to leave her sister and family, never to see them again, to follow a stranger that's ridiculously good at killing over the ocean. WHY?!? Now I haven't finished the book but from my past experience they're gonna be soulmates from now on.....unless I'm leaping to judgements. It just annoys me that these relationships, which are going to have huge effects on the story and the characters, have no development at all and are just forced down our throats. I'd rather have no romances at all rather than bad ones cause Erickson is so good at the other elements of the book it would make up for it.

All I know is I’m scared, and even if no one will believe me, I know that this community will. And shit, if I disappear, or if it’s happened to someone else, at least I’ll have written it down.  Maybe I’m not alone.Today, or I guess now, yesterday, I was driving up north from my city to my family’s cabin. Every year we do a Memorial Week celebration, and this year was my turn to set up the cabin and air it out. No one likes sleeping with spiders. I’d meant to leave the city right after work, but first I had to drop the dog off my boyfriend’s house, and then, you know, we got distracted… anyway, I left later than I meant to, traffic was awful, and next thing you know it’s dark out. It’s a long drive, and 10 pm I was still a good four hours from the cabin. An hour before I’d stopped in a small town for a bite at a small diner. It was the last place I’d have cell reception before reaching the very wayside I’m writing this from. Anyway, I ordered dinner and as I was polishing off my French fries, I called my mom and told her what my ETA would be to the cabin; as always, before hanging up, she told me to be safe and that if I got too tired, to pull over and sleep before continuing on. She just wanted me to be safe. As always, I told her thanks, but I’d be fine. I was on the road for another hour and all seemed fine. I’d long since lost cell reception, but it was okay since I knew that in an hour and a half I’d have it back and I was still on the rural highway headed North. At this point, my eyes were growing my heavy and my music wasn’t doing a good job of keeping me awake. It had been a long day, and I was exhausted. The road seemed to blur in front of me, and I was finding it harder and harder to pay attention. My mom’s advice to just pull over and sleep, if only for an hour, kept rattling around in my head. After a few more minutes of fighting to keep my eyes open, I decided to pull onto the shoulder. I locked the doors, unbuckled my seatbelt, pushed the driver’s seat back as far as it would go, and set my phone alarm for 11:30. All I needed was a thirty minute nap and I’d be good to push through for the next few hours. I took off my shoes, curled onto my side, and fell asleep.I woke up with a start what seemed like minutes later. Everything was totally silent—there wasn’t even the quiet sound of the engine cooling. Figuring I had at least another twenty minutes left, I checked my phone for the time. Even though it’d been charging as I drove, it had somehow died while I slept. Whatever, no big deal. Now was as good as time as any to resume driving. I was already feeling a small amount of fear from sitting in the pitch black wilderness of the Northwoods, with the only light coming from the stars above.I fished the keys out of the cupholder and jammed them in the ignition. As the engine turned over and my headlights came on, light flooded the road in front of me. I looked down to buckle my seatbelt when from the corner of my eye, a man erupts from the woods, screaming.He ran straight at my car, screaming for help. He was wearing a white t-shirt, khaki shorts, and was bare-footed, with dirt up to his shins.  As he ran at me I froze, all I could do was stare as he got closer. His shirt was soaked with sweat and what looked to be blood, and judging by the front of his shorts, it looked like he’d pissed himself. It wasn’t until he was feet from the car that I jerked back into motion. All I could do was say fuck over and over, as I frantically tried to kick my shoes out of the way to put the car into gear. My palms were slick with sweat and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears as I tried to move faster, but one of my shoes was caught on the brake. Now he was banging on the driver’s side window. His face was a mess of dirt, blood, and snot, and his hands left streaks on the glass. He was begging. God, I wanted to help but I knew I had to leave. What if whatever was coming after him got me?Bending down, I grabbed the shoe and gave it a sharp tug. Finally it came free. I jerked the car into drive only to see the man had now moved in front of the car, blocking my way. I didn’t want to hit him so I threw the car into reverse.I turned to look behind me when out of the woods melted more men. Fuck.Launching back into drive, the car jolted forward, narrowly missing the screaming man as I sped away. Coming out of the woods like a tide were men. It must’ve been hundreds. They were behind me on the road and pouring out from either side of me; as I flew down the side of the road they surrounded the screaming man. I don’t think the speedometer came down from 100 until now, reaching this wayside. It’s well-lit, it has internet and security cameras, and seems the only safe place to stop until I reach the cabin. My heart still hasn’t stopped racing. I’m turning to you guys because I don’t know what I should do—should I call the cops or ignore it? Because the strangest thing of all?The men who came pouring out of the woods all looked identical. Each and every one of them were wearing a spotless black suit, tinted glasses, and holding a thin, narrow briefcase.What cop is going to believe that?I need your help. I'm posting this and continuing on to the cabin... I just hope I make it.",

You've got a great beat that's easy on the ears and is incredibly infectious but not at the point of dumbing it down for the listener like a lot of pop fare. You've got some great singing on Vic's part and the song doesn't evolve in the standard verse-chorus-verse way of a Katy Perry song. Now part of it is likely because of the fact it didn't get major label push like Katy Perry but still, you'd think a song this catchy would be able to push past that. However I know that music taste is subjective so I understand that what I might find a hit, others would find a dud. But looking at it from a non-fan's perspective still leaves me with the same conclusion, I can think of nothing that would hold this song back from taking off. So what do you guys think? What makes a song a hit? Is it some element of pure randomness that gets it to the top of the Billboard Hot 100? Or is it simple coordination on the part of major labels?",

But what I'm confused about is what kind of IMAX theater Nolan is wanting us to see it in.I know there are the \"Lie-MAX\" theaters, that I'm guessing are just larger flat screens with the IMAX name. Are the true IMAX screens that Nolan is talking about, the Dome versions...or what? Are the flat-large screens also what he could be talking about?I found [this neat website with a list of IMAX theaters](http://www.lfexaminer.com/theaUSA.htm) that includes if the theater is Dome or Flat.When I saw Star Wars: TFA, I went to the Fort Worth Museum because it was recommended and I think I read it's one of the only true IMAX theaters. It's a dome. So TL;DR - What kind of IMAX theater are the directors wanting us to see their movies in?",

I say officially because she finally told me she wants to be independent and single in college since we started dating her freshman year, which I'm actually fine with and understand and I also need to get some of my personal things together still and focus on myself. We had a date set for her birthday but decided it would be a bad idea to see each other. She basically told me that if we get back together now, marriage would be the next step in a way, which flattered me to think she was thinking we could get married haha. I just told her that I'm not even thinking of marriage, told her I understand her mindset and that I would be willing to try again in the future if it ever comes up. She told me that it irritated her a little that I was trying to get her back because it seemed like I didn't know what I had, etc. I just said I knew what I had and otherwise I wouldn't have tried so hard in the relationship. Then she just told me not to wait for her, which I never said I would.Anyway, this was my first serious relationship and hers as well. I want to kinda get over this feeling I have that we might get back together \"in the future\". I can't figure out how to just get that feeling out of my head because it's not going to help me heal and while I'm still going to have that hope and positive attitude about working things out with her at some point because we had a good thing that was only broken up because of life situations, I just want to stop focusing on that so I can start moving on and stop focusing so much on getting back together \"in the future.\" EDIT: So I called her because she was deleting pics of us off instagram and I wanted closure. She basically said it was over, said we started dating when she was 18 two years ago and now wants to be single. I don't really get how she can move on so quickly and I feel like a complete bitch with how I'm acting now. I just feel completely hurt with how she talked to me after 1.5 years of being together and wanting answers, though I guess she was doing it for both of our sakes so that I'm not left on a string. I feel like a complete fool with how I still think we might work stuff out in the far future because I still don't really feel done yet. I'm just going to move on and let time do it's thing. If it's meant to be, it'll be I guess. I just can't help but feel sad with how we just started dating at the wrong time and I really do wish her well from here and truly do hope we can work stuff out in the future after being together for so long.---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend and I broke up officially Saturday, she wants to be single and enjoy independence, which I understand. She said if we get back together, marriage might be next and she is a little freaked out about it, which I don't understand but whatever. I told her I would be willing to try again in the future when we're both older. I want help to get that feeling of getting back together \"in the future\" out of my head or at least stop focusing on it as much so I can heal and just take things as they come.",

Not useful as often and I hate dead cards, but when it's useful it's *really* usefulOracle of Mul Daya- amazing card. Only reason I would cut it is because it doesn't have inherent synergy outside of being really good (and good if I happen to draw too many lands so in that way it can filter the top of my library)Dearhbringer thoctar- it's expensive for a deck that is trying to lower the cost, and will often be killed before maximizing value.

It's a recurrable flying blocker, and can trade with Prossh and other X/6 threats. I'm thinking Ashnod's Altar for Vampiric Rites and Deathbringer Thoctar for Skullwinder, but could really use a second opinion as the pros and cons of these changes are subtle and nuanced.

All of it?:**All of it would be awesome, but the Intro and the first part of the chorus would already be cool. (From 0:00 to 1:40)**Which guitar? Lead or rhythm? Bass?**There's no clear guitar in the song, I would love to have a tab for a lead guitar of the melody of the people who are singing. It would be nice if the background music would be included as well (the accordeon), but I get that must be very hard, so I'm satisfied with any kind of tab of this song. **Timestamps?** 0:00 - 1:40 **The song is basically built like this**: *Intro: 0:00 - 1:00*with the first 15 second just an according making, it seems, simple sounds. Then Josh Groban starts singing *\"There's a war going on out there somewhere, and Andrey isn't here\"* and that's basically the intro but repeated a few times (in slightly different intonations/melodies) Then there's a **door slam** (something that's easy to copy with a guitar I think, just slamming the strings once with an flat hand to stop every sound? I think that would be really cool.)After the door slam, a person says \"RAZ DVAH TREE\" (one two three in Russian) and then the chorus starts.*Chorus: 1:00 - 1:23* After the chorus, characters are being introduced in constantly the same way (**Name, Name is X, He/she Y, he/she Y, Name is X, (other name is Z, other name is H,.. etc) and Andrey isn't here**). It would be cool if I just had the tabs till that moment, otherwise this is how the rest goes:The chorus starts again, more characters are introduced like that with the chain getting longer. Then there's a bridge (I think), when people sing *Chandeliers and caviar, the war can't touch us here*, and after that you have the same format as before (*name, Name is X, He/she Y*). The song ends open-ended with *\"What about Pierre, our dear bewildered and awkward Pierre?\"*. I think it would be cool to transfer the voices to guitar sounds (the accordeon in the background would be nice too but I don't think it's possible to have them both be played on the same guitar, but what do I know). The song seems to me repetitive and easy to tab (at least, that's what I hope).**This is already available**[Chords 1](https://chordify.net/chords/natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-prologue-musicalsongs6), [Chords 2](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/m/misc_soundtrack/natasha_pierre_and_the_great_comet_of_1812_-_prologue_ukulele_crd.htm) (but now how to play them/which strings to play, I think it's more the background way to play them instead of the voices)[The complete sheet music](https://musescore.com/user/219366/scores/2737516)*Sorry for the layman's talk* ",

Ideas that come to mind are Ratchet's many in-game armors like the Commando Suit or the Infernox and Carbonox Armor. For other characters like the Tyhrranoid, it has a different version including its robotic version. Enhancing other characters like Robo and Trooper would have to happen as well.**WEAPON MODS:**Shock mod, acid mod, lava mod...reminds me of Deadlocked and was a good idea. Have them picked up in boxes around the map that perhaps generate rarely so it isn't so easy to get.**TOURNAMENT GAME MODE:**Standard tournament, I guess. Depending on the people in the game, people are matched up against each other to see who will win. Would go well with an arena that we didn't really get.------------------------------------The weapons are pretty standard and so is its upgrading system (can't have too many upgrades or else it will be incredibly unbalanced), so I can't think of any new weapons. Perhaps the [Chopper](http://ratchet.wikia.com/wiki/Chopper)? Perhaps different wrenches? Dual laser saber? If you have an idea, list it below! **WE MUST SEND THIS TO INSOMNIAC GAMES!**",

You gonna hit lvl 6 a lot earlier than other junglers who need to back because they lack sustain. His ult has always been very strong. Now combined with skirmishers, your ult deals even MORE damage and allows for super strong ganks.Dragon can not be soloed by many jungler, but warwick (and pantheon) is one of the few who can at lvl 6-7 (haven't tried earlier).So, for everyone who wants to climb, without having a hard time, SPAM warwick. He is not hard to play, requires mostly decision making (when &amp; who to ult) and is just absurdly strong right now.For Runes I suggest focusing on Attack Speed to keep your passive up in the Jungle. As far as Jungle item goes; Skirmishers with Devourer enchantment.For Builds;Skirmishers - BOTRK are core.If you're doing awesome Witt's End.If you're just doing fine, Tanky with Randuins/Spirit/Visage.Boots are whatever you prefer.

But when it comes to things that I *cannot* see, such as the urge to surf, gamble, fap, game or whatever else, I'm absolutely screwed.

It's what I can't see. The internet isn't a drug (although it certainly feels like one). I can't pop it like I can a pill, or drink it down like I can liquor. It's an urge that manifests internally, and since I can't see it, the likelihood of it becoming a problem is high. And it has.But I've learned a lot during my period of listless impulsiveness, and it's a period of my life that I'll hopefully look back on one day from a better place. Striving for that better place starts today.Farewell, and I wish you all the absolute best in your goal to quit/strictly limit your surfing time.",

		"text": "Just going to look at this from a purely mathematical and historical point of view. First and foremost, no matter how much people like to make fun of the \"media mogul,\" Frankie is the most famous houseguest this season, no argument about it. Not sure how many he had before the season started, but right now Frankie has 719,000 followers on Twitter. Just to put that into perspective against past America's favorite winners, Elissa Slater has 111K, Britney Haynes has 145K, and Jeff Schroeder, the CBS golden boy himself has....224K. Just for some other fun with numbers, Julie Chen has 111K followers, and the official BB update page has 133K.Not saying that Twitter is the leading authority on anything, it is just an easy way to look at approximate fan count, and there is probably some correlation between the people that follow the Big Brother Greats' Twitter accounts and those that actually call/text in to vote. I consider myself a big fan and I have never called in.Now, let's look at last season in particular, the season of some pretty widely hated players. I remember this sub in particular and how often Elissa Slater was pretty much universally despised. Except she won America's MVP and America's favorite. I would very much agree that she was not a fun player to watch, she wasn't particularly good at the game, she was kind of an uppity bitch, she threatened to walk out of jury, she was pretty much handed constant power, etc, etc. There were a lot of reasons not to like her. So when she won America's Favorite, what did everybody here claim? That she won because she was Rachel Reilly's sister and that she won because of her fans' support.Well, if we are factoring in \"famous\" sisters, as of today, Rachel Reilly has 208K followers. Ariana Grande has 17.5 Million. So if we are talking about the power of tweeting, that's a competition that I think we can all see the results of.\"But what if we can get everybody to vote for one person? Surely that can outweigh those numbers! After all, we are a community! And EVERYBODY hates Frankie on here so we can do it!\" you say.I honestly wonder what would happen if we could get that to happen. But, looking at the BB wiki (which is editable by anybody so I am not sure how seriously to take it), Jeff Schroeder has the highest percentage vote for America's Favorite at 36%. So on top of the already stacked odds that is the fan numbers, among the people not voting for Frankie, there is a huge split in the Big Brother Fandom.I would say Zach and Donny are pretty equally beloved, a nice 50/50 split. But wait! There is still Derrick, some of whom are claiming that, if he wins, could be considered one of the top three players of all time. I think it would be a safe estimate to say that one of the top three players of all time could pull 10-20% for America's Favorite vote. That leaves our bearded hero and his rambunctious buddy with only 45-40% of the vote each. But wait! Cody is so HAWT! Hawt enough for me to vote for! Boom. There goes another 5%. And Nicole is just so adorkable. Another 5%. And it was just so unfair for Amber's game to be affected like that. 3%. And Hayden could have gone really far if not for the double eviction. 3%. And let's not forget the opinion on Beast Mode Cowboy has flipped since everybody forgot about how crazy he is. I'm sure he could pull 3%. Well that's another 20% right there, and all of a sudden Zach and Donny are down to 30% each.Obviously those numbers are complete bullshit. The point is that it is hard for one person to come out ahead when the remaining votes are some-kind-of-split fifteen other ways. Now I would like to say that Frankie is by no means my personal choice as America's Favorite. I would love to eat this entire post at the end of the season. I just really don't see how Frankie can lose and I don't see how people can truly think somebody can beat him (and his sister). So for all of you threatening to rampage if he wins, I'm giving you a six week heads up to come to terms.",

I tried a bunch of new moisturizers all one after the other; CeraVe products all seemed to give me small closed comedones along my jawline near the corners of my mouth.I finally hit upon a couple of products that seemed to help with the dryness (OCM with squalane and using LaRoche Posay Toleriane Riche moisturizer), but the CCs haven't gone away after about a month? It's been at least two months since I tried a CeraVe product... I honestly can't tell anymore what is being caused by the products I'm currently on and the products I was experimenting with a couple of months ago!At the end of all my experimentation, my routine was:AM: wash with lukewarm water; Neutrogena Oil-free moisturizer for combination skin (for oily t-zone; same moisturizer but for sensitive skin (for cheeks); LRP Toleriane Riche on dry patchesPM: OCM with squalane; rinse with micellar water (not every night); Neutrogena Oil-free sensitive all over; LRP Toleriane Riche on cheeksAside from the CCs, everything was going pretty well! But I figured maybe I was overexfoliating, or maybe the squalane was causing a delayed reaction so this past week I went back to the routine that I had that worked perfectly before the dry patches showed up, minus the Retin-A Micro:AM and PM: wash with water; Neutrogena sensitive and combination skin (these have worked great on my skin for years)The dehydration is mostly gone thanks to LRP, but the CCs are persisent little buggers, and I've NEVER had them before... Should I stay off Retin-A Micro for a while? Could the CeraVe have caused a purge that I should push through? I've been looking into treatments for CCs like Stridex pads, but I'm almost afraid to try any more exfoliators right now in case this is the result of overexfoliation :( How can I tell which it is?",

Every Saturday and Sunday, I sleep a lot, but I also  have to mop, vacuum, take out the trash and recycling, clean the bathroom, do laundry, go food shopping, pay bills, lesson plans, etc. because I'm too tired (and perhaps lazy) to do any of that during the week. Plus I teach Sunday School for half a day on Sundays so that gives me less time to get stuff done too.Anyway, at the moment I have no social life because I feel like I'm constantly on a treadmill that keeps running and I never feel like I'm completely accomplished with either school or chores/errands/bills. I love teaching, and I know I have adult responsibilities, but is this how every teacher's weekend is? I feel like other teachers actually have a life. Any tips for how to make that happen?

We are a sub where you an ask questions about pretty much anything! We hope you enjoy your stay! This post is intended to give people a quick run down of some rules and guidelines, aimed at (but not limited to by any means) new people, although it's always good to remind oneself of the rules sometimes (HINT: THAT MEANS THIS POST IS FOR EVERYONE).**TL;DR: Don't be an asshole, read the FAQ and use the search to see if a similar question has been asked, and message us if you have any questions, concerns or issues.****Q: Can women answer questions?**A: Of course!!! Women are an important part of this sub and commenting and responding to posts is always encouraged, regardless of your gender or however you identify!**Q: I really want serious answers. Should I use the [serious] tag???**A: No. We don't moderate for that tag, so it won't actually do you any good. So please don't use the serious tag.**Q: Why can't I use a throwaway account??**A: Because I said so? But also because we have continuous problems with users who create throwaway accounts and spam us with questions designed to rev up the internet haet machine, and then they take the answers and cross post them to other subs to stir up drama. And that shit just ain't productive.**Q: Can I randomly insult people here?**A: No. If you do, we'll remove it. And if you think you're cool and take it to PM and we find out (and we will find out), you'll probably get banned.**Q: I'm from askreddit, and I'm trying to ask a sex question because it's sex-free week (re: month), but it keeps getting removed. Why??**A: Because you probably didn't search the FAQ and use the search bar and realize that it's been asked before. Multiple times.**Q: But mine is different!!!**A: No, it's not.**Q: Can I use \"not knowing how to use the search bar\" as an excuse to post it anyways?**A: No, and stop it.**Q: RK, did you just simulate a modmail message all by yourself??**A: Yes, yes I did. Now that we've all had that conversation, we can not have it. So just use the search bar and check the FAQs first.**Q: AskMen, this guy is acting weird. Why is he acting this way??? Can I ask you guys about it??**A: No. And we don't know. We're not psychics, so **do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.****Q: But it's not just this guy, it's all guys! This guy is just an example!**A: No. Just no.**Q: RK, did you do that thing again where you responded to a generic modmail question?**A: Yes, yes I did.**Q: Can I talk shit about other subs in here?**A: No, threads intended to stir up drama are not allowed here. In fact, links to other subs will be removed automatically, and you must appeal to the mods before approval. This is to prevent brigading. If we find out that brigading has occurred due to a post, the thread will be removed.**Q: I'm really angry about this one thing and I want people to validate my opinion.  Why have the moderators taken it down?  God damn Nazi mods always ruin everything?**A: If you want to rant about something, go to /r/offmychest or /r/rant or whatever other subs allow that bullshit.  If you're going to ask a super loaded question like \"Why do all men rape EVERYTHING EVER YOU GODDAMN MISOGYNISTIC PATRIARCHIC SCUM OF THE EARTH GODDAMIT I HATE YOU\" and then fight with every poster who says \"men don't always rape everything\", then you're obviously not here to ask a question, you just want to fight something, and there are far better ways to take your anger out on the world than arguing with strangers on the internet.  So take it somewhere else, Lewis Black.**Q: I've got a cool website that I'm trying to shamelessly plug. Can I plug it here?**A: Sure, but if you don't message the mods first, your shameless plug will be unplugged.**Q: IVV REMOVED MY POST SHE SUCKS BECAUSE SHE'S A GIRL MOD**A: ayy lmao k**Q: What's a good gift for--**A: STOP.  GO TO /R/GIFTS.  GO DIRECTLY TO /R/GIFTS.  DO NOT POST IN /R/ASKMEN.  DO NOT COLLECT $200.**Q: But it's not about a specific person!**A: Don't care.**Q: But I want to know what other men got for Christmas so that I can either subconsciously judge their girlfriends for not getting them better things or quickly rush to the store because I suck at gift giving!!**A: You can do that in /r/gifts.**Q: You suck you fucking nazi mod!**A: Yes, I am the kekking kike, come to ruin christmas and the holidays by directing you to a subreddit specifically designed for asking what to get people because we don't want a shit ton of those posts in this sub.  Because all of you and your partners are such special goddamn snowflakes that you think to bombard us with the same question that is asked day in and day out because you are either too dense to check /r/new or use the search bar, or maybe you just like it when you hit that submit button thinking of me raging to you reposting.  Well guess what: removing reposts gets me hard.  So thanks for helping me cum at night.**Q: What if I forget about these rules when trying to post?**A: Well, these are the same rules in the sidebar.However, since many people visiting here for the first time are on mobile devices or other apps which don't display our sidebar, it makes sense to have a read-only sticky post active when we don't have any other topic to sticky that lays out those rules for anyone visiting the sub.

		"text": "I'll start by saying that I'm only talking about the second and third seasons because 4+ got wacky due to the drama with Dan Harmon and the loss of Donald Glover and Chevy. I also adore many of the \"bigger, fast-paced, self-contained escapade\" episodes in 2 and 3, but I think 1 was overall much better and it mostly has to do with characterization. **1. Give Abed back his heart.** While character development can be good (see Jeff), I think they did a horrible job with Abed. In the first season, his insensitivity is a plot point sometimes, but it's just emotional blindness. By season three, it's downright indifference to his friends' feelings, which really seems to contradict his character in the first season. Early on, he was Aspberger-esque but still devoted to his friends; later, he seems cold and apathetic, and he loses all his charm. You can see this even by the end of the first episode of season 2 when he insults Jeff by saying that on TV, they have likeable leading men (which is totally untrue) and in real life, they have Jeff. This is already completely out of character for him, and it only goes downhill from there. (For a good contrast, see his relationship with Troy in S2E13/14 Digital Exploration of Interior Design/Pillows and Blankets and compare it to his behavior in S1E21 Contemporary American Poultry.)  And while he was extremely meta in the first season, he rarely if ever tried to shove other people into his make-believe worlds and movie/TV tropes: he did them entirely for himself and anyone that wanted to participate, like in The Art of Discourse with his list of college experiences.**2. De-Flanderize Britta.** As Jeff said in season 1, Britta is the heart of the group. She's got a strong conscience, she's humble and somewhat self-aware, and she's sort of adorably uncool. But of course, that last trait takes her over by the end of the third season: her entire purpose is to do things that make people say, \"Ugh, you're the worst.\" Granted, she was far from my favorite character in the first season, but she was a necessary straightman whose destruction threw the dynamic of the group into chaos.**3. Nix the Chang-wants-to-be-in-the-study-group dynamic.** The way he obsessively pandered to the group was boring, and ruined the fun of his character. While he was always shameless and sort of crazy, I got the sense in the first season that he really accepted himself and wouldn't try to change for anyone (except maybe his wife). His constant pandering to the group seemed incredibly insincere and out of line with his eccentric, unabashed brand of confidence in season 1.**4. Bring Duncan in more often.** This isn't a character issue, and I don't think I really need to explain it. I just love John Oliver. I think all of the episodes that disappointed me in the second and third seasons would have been improved if they had restructured the stories around these character changes.",

So I made this site.And here's a quick summary of the features I suggest...**Phone Section**The phone has some nice gameplay aspects. But there are too many submenus. This version of the phone introduces more streamlined apps for faster access, as well as some extra features I personally think would be nice. For example, under the Lamar app, you can \"Request a Lowrider.\" Since the lowriders are expensive but also extensive in their features, why not allow players to summon a free, randomly customized one (which they can't keep)?**Bodies Section**This one is pretty straightfoward. The game should let you pick your body type/race from the start, and not have you jumping through hoops to make an attractive girl character. I think a plastic surgery (like Saints Row) feature would be nice too.**Weapons Section**The weapon management system is very loose. Your best bet is to buy a weapon locker which you can only get after buying an expensive office. Nicely enough, many of the guns in the game are almost the same feature-wise.**Beauty Section**Better outfits and styles for women. Dresses, long hairstyles, nail polish, etc. Some of these assets are already in game, too.**HUD Section and Misc Section**When I originally made my notes for this site, I had a field day noting all the issues. Instead of getting frustrated and cursing out R*, I just made these sections. Some of the issues include redundant stats, unclear stats, or incorrect stats on items, characters and/or guns. Also, there are simple things I'd like to see, such as a timer which shows when your bounty runs out.**Radio**Hold down Q 😉",

		"text": "I want to preface this by saying that I don't blame League of Legends or Riot for the following in any way, there are tens of millions of people who play the game every day with no ill effect. Unfortunately, I am not one of them.WALL OF TEXTI started playing LoL almost two years ago after a friend got me into it as a way to spend more time together. Obviously, he was (and is) quite a bit better than me, so although he never pushed me, it was a constant battle and goal to climb to his level. I had never played any online games other than very casual Call of Duty on XBox 360 so this was a whole new world for me.It started out so fun with the champions and the gameplay and slowly but surely getting better with the majority of my games being in normals with my friend and his group mates. They were all very high level players, so with the coordination on the team we could usually win even with me being the lowest by far ELO on the map.As I became more comfortable and natural with the game play, I played on my own more often so that I could play against my own level, and it slowly took over the majority of my free time. I never became a stereotypical shut in by any means, but there have been more than a few weekends where staying in and playing sounded a lot better than all the hassle and effort that going out can be.It was probably about 5 months in to playing that I got my account banned. I didn't really think much of it as I was new to the ranked structure and after all of what I had heard said on mics in CoD, I considered it a learning experience that you can't be quite as vulgar in the text chat.So, I made a new account and started building it up again which wasn't all that difficult since I was better than all the other true new players but wasn't so good that I was destroying them. I got to level 26 before this one was banned.At the same time, through the military, I was unfortunately re-stationed to a new base away from all of my friends. League became an easy way to keep in contact with a few of them while at the same time giving me something to do at this new location that I hated with a passion. So since I had nothing to do or that I wanted to do, I played league. And I wanted to get better, so I read about league. I watched videos about league. I followed professional league.Up until this point, I had never spent a dime on the game. However, after my second account got banned, I discovered that you could skip all the climbing and buy relatively cheap level 30 accounts online. And since at this point, this game was both my \"casual\" entertainment as well as my emotional tether to people that I was missing, what did it mean to drop $5 on an account to be able to jump right into it again?To be honest, I don't really know when or how it happened. The ratio of fun to stressful games that I played was becoming a very small number. In my effort to climb, I started viewing lost games as wastes of time as opposed to learning experiences and the people that I blamed for those losses were just obstacles. At some point the insults and vulgarity that I would type just in reaction or to nobody in particular started becoming aimed at and custom-tailored to the individuals that in my view were holding me back. The anonymity of the game was a shield and I didn't really mean what I would say, so it didn't matter to me--it was just a way to get out the anger and the frustration both with the game and with my life.The bans started coming much more quickly now. I made comfortable money and didn't have too many bills, so it didn't really matter if I spent another few dollars every couple of weeks to keep going. But as I went on, I wanted the fuller and more expensive accounts. I made excuses to friends about why accounts got banned when I would have to send them a new friend request. I just eventually stopped re-friending them or doing it every other account or so. Anybody who talked shit to me got challenged to a 1v1. And of course I won, I constantly had a new account that got to level 30 through game-spamming bots and was playing with and against people lower skill than me. But I felt powerful like a school yard bully. I was the quintessential \"that guy\".I haven't done a total tally, part of me is still too embarrassed to do so, but a conservative guess would probably put the number of accounts that I got banned around 30. Probably $400 to $500 worth.I still don't understand it completely. I have played sports my whole life, I have anxiety and competition issues, and I have been cheated on. Nothing has ever made me as angry as I can get when I play this game. I absolutely hated how it made me feel and how vile I could be. I can't remember the last time that I played a solo game and had a positive experience. But I kept going back for more and more every time. So a few weeks ago I finally deleted it and haven't looked back. I hesitate to call my relationship with League of Legends an addiction. I never neglected any of my important responsibilities, never chose to buy a new account instead of paying a bill, and when I actually decided to stop playing it was very easy and has been so far. I don't want to put myself into a category that does not fit the reality. The relationship was unhealthy at the very least and there are some ramifications that I will probably have to deal with for a while. That being said, I wanted to share my story with you all (1) because I think that this is a community that can understand and (2) because I am proud of cutting out something that was negatively impacting my life. If you have stuck with this text until this far, thank you for your time. TLDR: A dramatic and overall meaningless struggle of man vs technology but more importantly man vs self. I couldn't handle playing a simple video game. ",

I witnessed his health decline for the past 9 months, and it declined rapidly starting in June. During this time he never told me and I didn't have the courage to flat out ask him what he was suffering from. Anyway, we kept hanging out like normal while he was getting sick and i visited him constantly when he was in and out of the hospital to be there for support. Fast forward to 9/13 I got a call to come to the hospital because my friend was taking his last breaths. He was alive but not mentally responsive when I got to the hospital. I along with my friends friends and family were in the hospital room for about 2 hours before my friend passed away. He went very peacefully.Now 11 days later, i have done my fare share of crying but what I find myself really struggling with is keeping my mind from constantly replaying his final moments. It's like it's on a constant loop in my mind. The moment my mind isn't distracted by work or something it automatically defaults to replaying my friends final moments like a cruel joke. When I find myself thinking about it I say out loud. ... stop..in an effort to snap myself out of it, but doing that only seems to make me focus on it more.Guys who found themselves in similar situations...what did you do to cope?",

My first reaction is fuck me i am going to have to restore it and put my music back on. But now it wont connect to my windows 8 laptop at all.

		"text": "Ever since my CD player broke in my car, I've been forced to use the FM radio. I prefer rock music, but I can get into most kinds of music.  I've noticed recently how much garbage the rock stations are.  First of all, they don't even play music in the morning, it's all talk radio. They have morning shows that are supposed to be funny, but they aren't anywhere close to being so.  It's just a bunch of annoying guys laughing at their own pathetic jokes. When I'm driving to work in the morning, half asleep, I want MUSIC, not some guy with an annoying voice pretending to laugh at his own \"jokes\". Next, they have so many goddam commercials. It seems like more than half the time I put any of those damn stations on, it's a commercial.  And if I was lucky enough to catch the last 30 seconds of a decent song, Im almost always going to have to wait for 15 minutes before I get to hear another.  And they always talk about their sponsor between songs. And they all put their commercial breaks at the same time, so you can't even switch stations. Lastly. almost all rock stations around me play like the same five songs. Especially Led Zeppelin, I don't know what it is, but all of the stations play literally the same 3 songs by them over and over. So basically if I'm lucky enough to catch one of these stations not in a commercial break or obnoxious talk show, it's almost always going to be a song they've played 300 times before. Contrast this to rap and pop stations. they have very few commercial breaks, no talk, go from one song right to another.  Granted, they'll play the new hits a lot, but in between them there's variety. I don't think it's money, these rock stations have been around for decades, throw festivals, and have plenty of sponsors. I just think they know that people that like rock will listen to them anyway, whereas the rap and pop stations are newer and need to actually be good for people to keep listening. ",

Some of them are of me on my own and some are of us hugging, kissing, traveling, at concerts and raves, etc.We broke up in June, although I continued sleeping with him and with other guys I met bars and on dating sites until he left to a new city for his job. I went on to date / sleep with a few guys and I started dating my new boyfriend.  and my ex i still single. He texts me often and says that the photos remind him of our relationship. He posts them to my wall and tags me often on Instagram and Snapchat and Facebook whenever he uploads photos of us.He said that he wants to remember me forever, even if I marry my boyfriend I and have kids with him, and I do want to marry him. He knows that my boyfriend is insecure because he got rejected many times before meeting me and never dated or slept with anyone before me. He just kissed a few sorority girls before me. How do I make him delete the photos? Many of my sorority sisters and boyfriend’s fraternity brothers think I’m with my ex and believed that we broke up.TL;DR: how do I get my ex boyfriend to delete the photos of us?",

		"text": "I used to think that Cultivation was Ruin's antagonist, even more so than Preservation was: Preservation wants to keeps things as they are, Ruin wants them to change for the worst and Cultivation wants to change them for the better.This seems to contrast both with what Culti has been doing and what Odium said about her. For one thing, why is she doing nothing against Odium's plans? And important part of cultivating plants is making sure nothing comes and destroys them. And also, why did Odium imply that she wants bad things for Roshar?I think the answer to these questions is that Cultivation wants to change things for the better, but will try to do it via eugenics. She wants to sow chaos and hardships in Roshar so that only the fittest survive, therefore becoming stronger. That explains why she isn't actively working against Odium. We know she is against him, because she tells Dalinar that taking Evi's memories away from him would make him likely to become Odium's weapon, but still she won't give her boons freely to people who are against Odium. I think she does this because she wants to keep things balanced; if she gave too much power to one side that side would win easily, and would not be forced to become better. But this raises another question: has she given something to Odium's side? Well, I think she has. At one point she offers Dalinar \"a Blade that bleeds dark smoke and cannot be defeated\" (or something like that). This is very clearly Nightblood, which means it was in Culti's hands when Dalinar traveled to the Valley seven year before WoK. And then that sword ended up in the hands of Nalan, who is in Odium's side and seems to have been for quite a while.This theory also answers another mystery: why does Cultivation (or the Nightwatcher) give curses along with their boons? At face value it seems like Cultivation should be using her power to directly improve things. That, however, is more akin to Endownment, who does indeed just hand power to people on Nalthis. Cultivation gives a curse along with a boon because she wants to add some evolutive pressure to the individuals, and see how they fare, how they learn to work against it. (Although another possible explanation for this is that some of the curses seem to have ulterior motives behind: she makes Dalinar remember because that will avoid him becoming Odium's weapon, she gives Taravangian \"dumb\" days because that would make Odium more likely to approach him, she bonds Wyndle to Lift because she wants to have another Radiant in the fight. Maybe there was a reason why she made that guy see everything upside down (maybe he will become a Skybreaker/Windrunner and needs to have experience with being upside down?). Also, it makes me wonder that price did Nale pay for Nightblood.)So there you have it: I think that at some point Cultivation is going to become sort of a villain. Maybe she will be the bad guy (or gal) in the second five-book arch. There's a theory out there that in the future there will be an apocalyptic and never-ending storm that will flood all of Roshar. Maybe Culti will be responsible for it, or maybe she will come up with other ways to fuck things up.",

My setup:* Write down things I need to do each day* Map out tomorrow before going to bed* Check them off upon completion* Assign value to each task with either S, M or P.'S' is Spiritual, with urgency \"as needed.\" These would be things such as meditation, deep breathing practices, what have you.'M' is Mental, with urgency set to high. Reason is that I have a markedly more difficult time getting mental work done, so it takes a high priority so as not to burden myself later in the day.'P' is Physical, with urgency set to low. This will adjust over time in the event that something such as falling out of shape happens, or I've found myself becoming too sedentary. But the primary reason it's at a low urgency is due to the fact that I generally have a much easier time accomplishing physical tasks.A user from another subreddit also mentioned the idea of dividing things into three columns: before leaving the house, before leaving work area, and before going to bed, which I'll integrate into my journal.That's the plan as of right now.

So I pretty much realized that drunk me is getting better at socializing. Unfortunately, the cousin had a boyfriend of 8 years and all we did was hold hands. I probably could have made a move but I really didn't feel that comfortable with it. I could have made a move on the other girl but that was after my friend k-closed her (not sure if they fucked that night though). I was just holding her and looking into her eyes for a few seconds, she looked back and I had to keep drunk me from cock blocking my friend in his own hotel room. Not much of a field report, I know, but I just want to say to everyone how important it is to just go out with the mindset of having fun. It puts pressure off of yourself and it makes the night much more fun that way. I also noticed recently I'm getting better at seeing possible openings to make my moves, even though it's when I'm drunk. It's pretty awesome.",

Did you ever have to pull an all-nighter at the library or study with friends?- Were you able to easily get involved in various clubs and organizations on campus (sports, band, literary clubs, etc.)? Any trouble finding the balancing between extracurriculars and academics?- What are some tips and pieces of advice that you learned from upperclassmen and faculty that really made freshmen year easier/less daunting?- What's the biggest piece of advice you can give a rising freshman like myself?Thanks! :)",

Granted, I'm not into switching, but I am quite curious what the sex life is like of my friends, or even just what their girlfriends look like naked. I also like the idea of people watching me and my girl going at it, or wondering what my girlfriend looks like naked. I actually enjoy noticing other guys noticing my girlfriend.The small thought was always in my head but never thought much of it actually happening in reality. But I guess it grew when a really close friend and I were bullshiting one night and talked about sex with our girls and mutually agreed that group sex with our SO's would be something we'd both be OK with as long as our girls were (non switching). It's never gotten further than that since we both have no clue where to even begin to make the idea a reality. But now I think about it with my other friends in relationships, and if they would be open to it, though I'd most likely never ask. I think keeping it as a fantasy is better and safer. I've been watching a lot of couples foursome porn lately to curb these fantasy cravings but it's something I'd love to do some day.Thoughts? Advice? Similar Stories? Let me hear it.",

Neither of them want help. Keep in mind, I consider myself a close friend to both of them and I'm not pushy or mean about the things I explain to them. Yes, I say things they don't want to hear, but I'm not forcing them to believe anything.The first one (15/F) has never received full treatment for her depression because she claims it would be too much of a financial burden on her family. She was immediately sort of upset about the medication she was supposed to take and how it didn't work. I explained to her that consistency is the key to recovery and she needs to be going through the whole shabang for at LEAST a year, and she only told me that she doesn't want help right now and she can't explain it. Pretty honest answer, I would say. This is obviously quite common behavior. How should I approach getting her help? I have reached out to a school guidance counselor about her condition and he said he will see what he can do, but other than that, I'm at a loss.The second one (16/F) is a bit different. She's much more hostile about it and basically denies everything I try to explain to her and gets really upset. She claims that she has gone through treatment for years and has given up because it does \"nothing at all\". If that's the case, it could be something extreme or possibly different. But anyways, she told me that therapists don't know what they're doing because they're only in it for the money, that people who recover are just whiny teens who think they have problems, and that I just have no idea what I'm talking about. Lot of different things thrown at me in her annoyance. I understand why it was annoying. I said what I had to say about consistency and how medical professionals really do know what they're doing, but that isn't what she wanted to hear and she just ended the conversation. Now, I don't know her in person. But she's someone special to me and her depression and anxiety comes from some pretty horrible experiences, along with an unhealthy relationship with her parents. I can't necessarily help her, but I want to try and...change her mind, I guess.Anyone who has dealt with others who were initially too hostile to want any sort of real help, how did they manage to come around? What kind of support did you give them that helped them? What should I do?",

Interested to see what you all think. In episode 1 of season 3 our Rick fabricates an origin story in order to gain control of the ___ (whatever the hell it was called: brainilizor?). The best lies are the ones that are based on a truth. What if the Rick that killed Rick's wife and Beth is our Rick and he just filled in the blanks to achieve the end he was trying to reach? And what if the Rick who our Rick did that to was Dufus Rick? I came across another theory related to the Evil Morty origin story and someone on here had suggested that Dufus Rick was the one who had really masterminded the plot to kill Ricks. Keep in mind that he wasn't just killing Ricks, he was downloading their memories. Why? He claimed it was to become a greater Rick, but that could just be a cover. The redditor goes on and points out that it was kind of interesting that Dufus Rick shows up to offer help just as the other Ricks are about to discover the remote control device implanted in the Rick that is later revealed to be under the control of Evil Morty. This is kind of flimsy evidence, but personally I do think it is interesting and my gut tells me it's worth considering. Dufus Rick had said that he had never had kids of his own, but maybe that was only a half-truth. I think Dufus Rick took on the persona of Dufus Rick in order to infiltrate and avoid suspicion from the other Ricks. Most of the Ricks are egotistical and prone to underestimate others who don't follow and embrace cold logic. Being a Dufus who eats shit would be the perfect cover as the only attention he would get from the other Ricks would be ridicule. Assuming this is true, then it's probable \"Dufus Rick\" came into the inter-dimensional traveling game a little later than the others or maybe they just hadn't structured a way of uniquely identifying the various dimensions. At any rate, Dufus Rick is out to avenge his family, but he doesn't know which Rick is the Rick that killed his family. So he gets in with the Citadel of Ricks and slowly gets to work on them one by one until he comes across Evil Morty and teaches him how to over come other Ricks. Together they start kidnapping Ricks and downloading their memories until they find the Rick that killed Dufus Rick's family. Obviously \"Evil Morty\" would have his own motives for cooperating, but I'm not interested in exploring this aspect of it in this post.This could explain why our Rick is so screwed up and how he mentions he couldn't make his marriage work. The Rick in the false origin story obviously had a good marriage and family. The other Rick from that false origin story kinda looked like the kind of douchebag that would be a shitty husband. When the series first started out our Rick displayed some qualities of being misogynistic. He didn't want to go on adventures with Summer and he didn't seem to really value Beth as much as he seems to now. Sure, he used pretty words around her but that was only a means to an end. He obviously didn't value her enough to stick around and try to help them in the Cronenberged world. The only one he seemed to value at all was Morty and we don't see until later how much he actually does value Morty. In the latest episode Rick admits that he hates himself and may think he deserves to die. I think Morty has to do with this. I think that Rick came to love Morty and then as the series went on he came to appreciate the rest of his family as well and we're even seeing signs of him coming to appreciate Jerry. I mean, being as logical as he is he has to value the rest of the family since Morty wouldn't exist without them. Rick coming to appreciate and love Morty was the beginning of Rick coming to regret what he had done to Dufus Rick. Ok I gonna go take a shit...Update: Alright y'all that shit was epic... It was around 1 lbs in case you all were wondering. So I just wanted to add one possible scenario we could see if this happens to be true. In The Whirley Dirly Conspiracy Rick and Jerry bond, then Jerry betrays Rick and the episode ends on a note of them bonding again. Jerry's betrayal could be foreshadowing an event where Dufus Rick tries to use Jerry in order to get to our Rick. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. ",

To me, my boy is very mature, he has read heavy books (Stephen king etc)  and has seen many movies with graphic violence and sex scenes.

I know for sure I was 8 or younger though because we moved out of that house when I had just turned 9. Anyway, my mom was very hands-on and not negligent at all, and I never ran into any trouble while being unsupervised. I was also very responsible though. So my question is, at what age can you leave a kid unsupervised while you nap, and does it depend on the maturity level of the kid as well?",

I think it's because I decided to try writing it in the 3rd person limited omniscient and usually I do 1st person.So, I decided to just read and forget it at the moment. I'm reading the Time Traveler's Wife, which I haven't read in years. And in the author's notes to commemorate its 10 year anniversary, she mentioned writing the book out of order by starting with the end, then various scenes in the middle (out of order), then perhaps the beginning. This gave me a lot of comfort because I felt like that's what I needed to do, especially because I have lots of scenes floating around in my head that I'm excited about. I guess I've always been one to have to do things \"in order,\" like I could never read a series out of order, although my friends could. I've been writing since middle school and it never dawned on me that I could write out of order. I'm using Scrivner, so I know that can make it easier to rearrange as well.TLDR:Question: How do you write your novels? Do you construct it in order from beginning to end? Or do you write scenes as they come and thing rearrange them? What's the story or storytelling process work for you?I enjoy learning from you all! Thanks!",

I've been having some trouble explaining to my friends what's been going on/the severity of it all, and just the fact that I'm basically sick for the rest of my life.

Everyone I see comments on how great I look, which gets so frustrating considering how incredibly painful (physically and mentally) these past few months have been. Does anyone have any advice/experience with how to explain to friends/family the severity of what's going on without sounding whiny or sharing too much?

		"text": "I'm not honestly sure this belongs here because he's more of a \"nice guy\" and less of a neckbeard as the guy in question is fit/attractive, but r/niceguys doesn't seem receptive to stories as I haven't seen any posted there so thought I'd try my luck on this sub. I had this friend since I was 11-12. Let's call him Will. We met at summer camp and were fast friends since we were both super into Star Wars and had friends in common. I had a crush on him at that time but it was very short-lived. We didn't see each other for a couple years but kept in touch online, and wound up at the same high school in freshman year. We were super close again super quick, although this time around I didn't have a crush on him. Word in our friend group was that he did have one on me off and on, but he never made any moves and I was always dating someone so it didn't matter. I was always very open about my sexuality and my involvement in the kink community, and we had an unofficial \"bondage club\" (which was half cringe, but half learning all sorts of things about safety and consent much earlier than even a lot of adults seem to). Will was always pretty conservative behaviorally even at bondage club so I figured he was just there socially; he was very easygoing and would come with us to lots of events that didn't necessarily align with his interests because we all just enjoyed spending time together. After high school he went to college several hours from where I went, and then went into the Navy, so we didn't see each other anymore since he didn't have much of an online presence and I struggle with keeping in touch with people I don't physically hang out with often. It's worth mentioning at this point that  at the end of 2008 (Will's and my senior year) I started dating this guy (we'll call him Simon). Simon and I got engaged in 2010, I got hit with nasty health problems in 2011 that led to multiple organ failure in 2012, and barely scraped by graduating college in 2013, at which point I was too sick to work any more than a small part-time job and was almost entirely supported financially by Simon. It didn't matter too terribly much because we intended to get married, he made a good salary, and I made up my lack of financial contribution by contributing in other ways, but I worried sometimes about what might happen to me if something happened to Simon since he had some issues of his own, and I knew from experience that sometimes life sneaks up and takes things from you. Without going into detail, after 6 years together, at the end of 2014 I lost Simon to a freak incident that I'd sell to television if I could. I was devastated and homeless, living out of my car while occasionally sleeping with friends or staying off and on with a parent who lived in town but had a history of being abusive. I hadn't even really talked to anyone yet aside from a few current close friends when Will shows up online out of the blue and starts chatting me up. Said he heard about Simon (still don't know how as I hadn't said anything on social media or told anybody who was super tight with Will at that point since after he joined the military he sort of fell out of contact with everybody, and the incident hadn't been on the news or anything) and said he was sorry to hear about what happened. We started talking again pretty hard. At first it was just playing catch up, remembering Simon, and reliving inside jokes and old times. But then he started making comments about my appearance, which he had never done before (I've always worn alternative fashion, mostly Japanese street fashion/lolita fashion which he liked in high school but he would compliment my outfits, not my appearance personally), how attractive I looked in certain pictures or things I wore, how much weight I'd lost and how good I looked (I lost ~60lbs due to health problems and was now underweight), and then, on only the second day of conversations, he mentioned wanting to grab coffee with me. I was totally game at first but we couldn't lock down a time or date because of my living situation and job and the fact that he didn't have a driver's license. That was fine, no hurry, whatever, he just wanted to see me, and at that point I wanted to see him too. Then he immediately mentioned how much he had always wanted to get kinky with me. That was a red flag I was stupid to blow off. Literally the day after you started talking to me about my partner of 6 years that I just lost and was now living out of my car with a host of health problems that nearly killed me, you bring *that* up? I kind of ignored it but then he kept bringing it up. I told him it made me uncomfortable and I wasn't really in the mood to talk about kink with *anybody* at that point, much less someone with whom I didn't have a romantic connection, and he apologized and said he was just trying to be nice and help me feel better and that even though I didn't have a partner anymore I was attractive to him (um, what?). The next several days were a blur of him constantly blowing up my phone and online chat applications telling me all about his kinks. Pregnancy and inflation. Furry something or other. Nipple clamps. Tying women to wooden chairs (why so specific, I'm not sure). Domming. (this man couldn't dom his way out of a paper bag lol) Just on and on, and not even one of his matched up with any of mine. It didn't matter if I ignored him, was at work (at the time I worked with small kids who were old enough to read and liked to play with my phone; I still thank the lucky stars they never saw any of his major explicit messages), asked him to stop, responded with platonic things, whatever. He always brought it back around to kink, sex, my body, erotica, etc. He asked me questions about my panty selling and camming and bondage performances, all things that I'd done in late high school/early college but he'd never paid any mind to it at that time; I figure now that it was out of respect for Simon because he clearly didn't have any respect for me or my boundaries at this point. Sometimes in my loneliness I'd answer him, which was a mistake--it egged him on to keep asking, because if he asked ten questions and only got an answer to one, he'd ask ten more to get one more answer. Again, I'd frequently tell him that I was uncomfortable with his caliber of conversation, I didn't want to talk about kink. But he made reference to my Fetlife profile being active, so apparently that meant I clearly did want to talk about kink (for the record I was barely active at all at that time on Fetlife so he probably just saw me liking people's photos or something, who knows). And again would reiterate that he was just trying to help, that he wanted to stave off loneliness, that he wanted to meet up and grab that coffee because he really missed me. I didn't miss him anymore at that point, and didn't really want that coffee either. He also mentioned frequently that he was a virgin and wanted to lose it, preferably to me; in perspective, while I don't judge anyone for their sexual activity or lack thereof, he was 24 at the time, fit, attractive, and was really fun (at least from a friendship standpoint), so the fact that he was a virgin but didn't want to be tells me that it was probably this kind of behavior towards women that drove them off. One night I was drunk and staying with my mom, who was pretty awful during this time, and I got roped into a roleplay with Will. Over text message. Drunk and stupid me went along with it for a little while; Will was physically attractive even if I didn't have feelings for him, and we were both pretty skilled text roleplayers; in fact  it was a pretty solid foundation of our friendship over the years (although it was generally Redwall or Star Wars adventure shit, not erotic or anything) but as I found my text-roleplay-self tied to a wooden chair wearing electric nipple clamps and a ballgag while he \"dominated\" me, I was done. I was just done. I was not taking his shit anymore. I'd like to say I went out with a bang, but I ghosted. Stopped responding on all platforms completely and permanently. I didn't block him, he could still see me being active on Facebook and coming on and offline on Google Hangouts and probably saw all the \"read receipts\" on the incessant texts he started sending me. But I was just done. At first it was \"hello? are you there? guess you're asleep\" which tapered to a stereotypical stream of \"hey\" \"hi\" \"hey\" and then the apologies started pouring in and I started to feel guilty. \"Are we going to finish the roleplay?\" \"Are we still friends?\" \"Do you want to talk anymore?\" \"I miss you. I was really looking forward to reconnecting.\" \"I'm really attracted to you.\" \"I was just trying to help. I'm sorry I couldn't help.\" He never dissolved into sending me dick pics or insulting me directly or threatening to hurt himself/anyone or calling me ugly or a slut or anything, but in ignoring my constant blatant discomfort which I directly expressed to him repeatedly, he had shown me that he certainly didn't respect me and wasn't being \"nice\" or \"trying to help\" in any way, shape, or form except to get his rocks off. I was really, really sad, because after a pattern of life showing me it can and will not hesitate to take everything you value away from you, I felt the loss of a longtime friend as well. For the next few months I might receive a \"hey\" here and there but it eventually stopped. I still wonder sometimes what happened to Will between high school graduation and these incidents that made him into that kind of person. I like to think we were close enough as teenagers that he wouldn't and couldn't fake a close friendship for so long just to hold out for a relationship or a hookup at that point in time. Maybe something happened in the military or something, I don't know. He works at a bar now a couple towns away from me. I make a point not to go to it. And we're never, ever getting that coffee.**tl;dr: old friend shows up after sudden loss of fiance and homelessness. tries incessantly to use kink and disrespect to \"help\" and \"be nice\" as I try to rebuild my life, so fucker gets ghosted and cries that he's trying to be helpful**Edit: it's worth mentioning that things are much better now :) I'm in a long-term relationship and have a full time professional job, a nice apartment, and a cat. Still have health problems but they're better controlled now. As for Will, I haven't talked to him since this incident and while he can still see my social media, he hasn't tried to contact me again.

If any of you fuckers even *think* about using margarine I'll shove my baster up your peeholes.), making certain not to leave any divots unsaturated.Third: Peanut butter on one waffle, raspberry preserves on the other. Now, I need to be clear here. DO NOT USE ADAMS OR SOME SUCH HIPPIE BULLSHIT. If you have to refrigerate it, it's the wrong goddamn peanut butter. Eat transfat-based products like JIF, as any good American would. It's peanut better. (Yeah, I dabble in the stonernomical sublime AND awesomely corny catch phrases. You got a question about it?)Fourth: 1.5 thick slices of delicious microwaved-for-5-minutes maple bacon. This is the *pièce de résistance*, as the white flag wavers might say. Yes, I microwave my bacon. Question? **Do not fry the goddamn bacon.** And when your sizzling, unflabby slice of love handle emerges, it should always be placed on the peanut buttered waffle. Fifth: Gently place the jammed waffle atop the bacon-topped peanut butter side. Apply *light* pressure to commingle all that spreadable goodness, and serve as a sandwich. Did it meet expectations? I dunno, did Watson make Ken Jennings its bitch? Did Divine dine on dog shit? Is Ron Swanson's mustache awesome?You dense?  The answer is yes. It was the greatest invention in ~~culinary~~ history.

Are there still any major holdouts?I have a rough idea of some of the apps I want to use, as I used to have an iPad 4 some years ago: - Noteability / GoodNotes for PDF annotation - Marvin for reading ebooks- GoodReader for catch-all file management - Vectornator for dabbling in vector-based artwork - Duet Display - Things for to-dosI also told the family member that I would like to wait for either the back to school promotion or any possible update simply because i know objectively that this is more of a “want” than a “need” given my current circumstances. If there are any particular holdouts, how is the overall experience? Is it like running iPhone-exclusive apps on the iPad?Additional question: when I used an iPad 4, I opted for the 64GB model, but never ended up using all of the storage.

He revamped old characters forgotten or marginalized by previous writers, created new concepts like different Lantern Corps and Blackest Night, and made the Green Lantern title a top-tier read on the same level of a Batman, Superman, or Wonder Woman book. The sheer scope and expansiveness of what he did rivals what Chris Claremont accomplished with the X-Men canon. But, that's just my opinion.How about you? ",

		"text": "Hello everyone, I started smoking around 4 years ago, when I was preparing to get into law school. I haven't ever been \"addicted\" to smoking, till late. It was a social activity for me, and I didn't have trouble not smoking for months during vacations and internship breaks, but once I get back to uni, it is as difficult as it is. Around March 30th, 2018, I saw a friend's 1 year quitting anniversary and he narrated to me about how good it felt. I got motivated and decided to stop cold turkey. Around 1 week later, during research paper submissions, all of my fellow students were stressing and smoking, and I gave in after a 24 hour+ craving. I've tried stopping a couple of times after it, but it is the time of the semester when stress is only increasing, as we're one week away from finals and everyone around me is smoking for \"stress release\". I want to quit right away. I know most health effects or smoking and benefits of quitting smoking. To add to it, I have PCOS too, but I somehow have a way of convincing myself thinking, \"You've smoked so many. This ONE won't kill or cause fatal damage\" (though I know it isn't true!). This might be relatable to a few here. Could you guys please help me to stop and never look back? I'm not addicted to nicotine so much as I'm addicted to the \"feeling\" of smoking. Idk if this makes sense, but I don't have withdrawals from not smoking. The reason I smoke another cigarette is because of my psyche, that I feel like I'm less stressed when I smoke a cigarette alone enjoying the weather or observing things. It's kinda difficult to explain. P.S.: I smoke 5 a day on a very active day, but on an average it is only about 2 cigarettes during the second half of the when I start getting tired and think that a cigarette would give me a good break and stress release.**tl;dr:** I'm a law school student addicted to the \"feeling\" of smoking a cigarette, and have almost 90% of people around me smoke as stress relief.",

I've seen on here that synthesia isn't really learning how to play a piano and just memorization.

So far I've been learning portions of songs that I like by picking out the melody.I'm wondering if I should go ahead and start forcing myself to try and learn to read sheet music, or if I should just go the way I have been by trying to learn by ear.

The whole idea of being dunked in water at as a sort of baptism would hint at that was it a book about man restarting civilization? What's it about vampires and a virus? What's it about a girl and her journey to save the world? Kinda, but the fact Amy is taking care of a lot during this novel would suggest otherwise. On the whole, the action sequences were incredible. I can't wait to see the battle sequins between Fanning and Amy in an abandoned New York City. Cronin frustrates me. He has the ability to create vivid portraits of characters and make you the reader, connect with them. In The Passage he did it with Carter, Wollgast, Amy's mother and Jonas Lear. In The Twelve, he did an amazing job with Grey. Who went from a loser pedophile to tortured confused hero. he also help draw out the character of Lila but not to a great extent but enough that she felt vivid. But, he can't for some reason do it with the main characters of this novel Peter, Alicia, Hollis, Sara, Michael, Caleb none of them feel fully fleshed out. They seem like cardboard cutouts of what hero should be with a little more detail. I was invested in any of these characters lives or emotions or romances. Even Amy, The linchpin of this whole novel could've used more details flushing her out on her experience with being alone after the end of the world. It would have made her more sympathetic and made me more connected to her. I also found it annoying in this trilogy there way too many false deaths. This isn't a comic book. If you're going to kill somebody, fucking kill him and show how that person's death affects the people around him. I don't know how Cronin can write a romance like the one between Fanning and Liz that makes me cry and not write compelling love triangles between the main characters. There were no moments between Peter and Amy that hinted at a romance it just sort of shows up randomly the same with Hollis and Sara, and Michael and Alicia. Just implied that off screen there's connections being formed. Plus in this book Peter looks really stupid, he has the opportunity to save hundreds of his people yet chooses to make a last stand and risk being entirety of humanity dying off. But then they end up on the ship anyways. And nobody seems to call him out for this. I never expected to identify and root for a character like Fanning so much. His story with Liz was one of the most compelling parts of the whole trilogy to me it was beautifully told and beautifully written. All I could think was \"This is how you write a love story.\" But his battle with Amy at the end was kind of anti-climactic. Yes there is that huge and awesome chase scene through an abandoned New York City but the conversation between them in the battle of my names that of been hinted at never happened. Plus I'm still confused at the end of The Twelve, how Wolgast was still alive. That really bothered me. But on the whole this trilogy was an amazing piece of fiction, with an amazing story that could've used more clear ideas about what it was trying to say in regards to religion and science. I look forward to seeing the movie adaptation and the TV adaptation and I hope they can do it justice.",

		"text": "This is a Pokemon MMORPG that would have a 3D anime-like look to it, so areas like routes would be vast like the anime and towns and cities would be large as well.A Pokemon game where you could do anything in the entire Pokemon world, like be a trainer, a coordinator, a breeder, a gambler, etc. Instead of everything about it being turn-based, though, it would live and you could control your Pokemon individually and move whenever you want. Wild Pokemon would just be standing around in places and all you'd need to do is send out your Pokemon and fight them right then and there. And you could do this alongside other players. I would personally make this game a one-time purchase only so you don't have to keep doing monthly payments or having to redeem it. However, each region would be a separate purchase (yet not a completely separate game; you can travel from one another using the same software. It would be more of an expansion-type deal). Just a marketing idea/technique that I wouldn't complain about. Just not a completely unreasonable price for it. Maybe $10-$20 each. This would obviously make it so that certain Pokemon are native to that region and events and such would be as well.This game (as a whole) would include:1. All 649+ Pokemon.2. Character customization.3. Pokemon customization.4. All main regions.5. Statistic system and leaderboard for best trainers and coordinators.6. All Pokemon leagues and frontiers to compete in and badges/symbols rewarded.7. Pokemon contests and cups and ribbons/trophies rewarded.8. Player Battle Tournaments with exclusive prizes.9. Events such as legendary events or specific character events.10. Live Pokedexes; ones that require you to take them out and identify the Pokemon in front of you with it in order for it to register.Own preferences:1. Legendary Pokemon are just that: legendary. They're incredibly rare and only a handful of dedicated players could own them increasing the rarity and the demand for trade. And they should only be available during events. Same idea goes for generally rare Pokemon.2. Stern currency system where money comes in short supply for doing jobs or winning battles, like you don't get thousands of Pokedollars for beating a Gym Leader or something. This would make extremely rare items like Master Balls incredibly expensive and only really dedicated players could buy one so not everyone can automatically catch any Pokemon they want after they woop Brock's ass.3. Pokeballs can miss, so you'd have to be careful with when, where, and how you throw it. And depending on where your Pokeball lands, it doesn't automatically become unusable once it's been thrown and misses. I mean, if it lands in the water or it falls off the edge of a cliff, it will be unusable, but not if you just land it in the grass.4. More than 4 moves you can use so long as TMs are fairly priced and you can remove them.5. Can dive underwater, surf, and fly with your Pokemon wherever you want on the map.6. Player levels. Every time you do something, not just your Pokemon level up, but your user does as well. This would be useful for leaderboard rankings and for other people to know who's experienced and who's not. Also, levels are unlimited for both Pokemon and Users, so your Pokemon can keep getting better so long as the experience requirement keeps getting reasonably larger just as much as for your user. And leveling up won't be that easy, so it would take regular playing to level up and evolve.7. You don't receive the general starter Pokemon as your first Pokemon. You're given Pokeballs and you just have to catch a weak one, train it, and search further areas for the general starter Pokemon and battle to catch those.I would be addicted to this type of game as I'm sure many of you would. Pokemon is such an amazing concept and an MMORPG would do so much good for the franchise. A lot of us have been dreaming for a game like this, so this needs to become a reality. Come on, guys. Email this to GameFreak.And please, leave suggestions for your own thoughts/ideas and upvote the good ones.",

I only really feel “happy” and stimulated when playing a video game, watching tv, or out somewhere environmentally interesting like a store or a concert. When I am not doing those things (or immediately after) I feel really depressed and bored. For example, I enjoy doing yoga and did some this morning. It was a 30 minute video. I felt unbelievably bored and unable to focus even though I know I enjoy doing it and feel “happy.” It’s like I just can’t get through normal activities that I enjoy because they’re so boring. I’m wondering if it’s possible this is undiagnosed adhd rather than just depression as I have always assumed it was. I also have a really tough time listening to my fiancé or best friend talk for longer than a couple of minutes at a time as my mind starts wandering or I just kind of zone out, even if I try really hard to focus. Same thing happened in school or when studying. Feel free to ask any further questions for clarification. Thanks!Edit: Necessary point I hadn’t thought to make originally: I know nobody here can diagnose me and that I need to meet with a psychiatrist. I don’t have insurance at the moment, so I was hoping if you guys suspect it is adhd, until I can afford to see a psychiatrist I might be able to try some coping techniques specifically for adhd instead of depression.",

What requirements do I have to follow to qualify as one?

This may or may not work for you; I'm just sharing what worked for me.I have no idea whether this method has a name or not, but it is a way to keep yourself motivated, motivate others and somewhat pressure yourself at the same time. This works best, if not only, when you have others you know who are also working on weight loss. Furthermore, you can apply this in other endeavors not related to weight loss. You and your partner(s) first set a goal to achieve in a month. This is **not** a common goal; you might aim to lose 4kg in a month while your partner might aim for 2kg instead. Then each of you will set some money aside for a pot and log your weight every week on a predetermined day. Now, some of you might be turned off because money is mentioned. This is **not** a competition or a bet among you and your partners. Recall that I mentioned each partner sets his or her own goal. The point of the goal is for each individual to achieve within four weeks. If you are able to achieve your goal, you don't lose any money. If not, you surrender your pot to the winner or winners and this is where the pressure aspect kicks in. You're competing against yourself and against time to achieve whatever goal you set.This is not a race with someone else; rather, it may be a race with yourself. You're using money to create an external motivation to lose weight.",

I'd call but everyone is closed at 2am. I paid for half of my very first bike purchase  back in the day with credit card and no stink was raised. Has anyone tried this? The other thing I guess would be to make sure such a purchase would trigger the bonus, so I'll need to call both the dealer and the card issuer later today. But I was hoping to gain some info here too in the meantime. Thank you.",

		"text": "Hi everyone!I've only been playing this game for a little over a week, and I didn't play the first destiny either, but I feel like the classes play out very similarly, or at least for me they do. Maybe I don't use my abilities enough, but here's a small idea on how to make them a bit more different. It's inspired by Battlefield 1, where there are more distinct roles for all the classes.BF1 has four classes, the Assault which gets SMGs and Shotguns, as well as explosives (dynamite, anti tank mines, etc), the Medic, which gets semi-auto rifles and heal/revive tools, the Support who gets LMGs and ammo crates as well as some explosives and a repair tool for vehicles etc, and the Scout who gets bolt action rifles and things like decoys, spotting flares and other such things. It worked a but differently in the previous games, but this is what we have at the moment.Essentially, the Assault is designed to get up on the objective and do damage, the Medics and Support players follow through, and the Scouts hang back. That's not to say you can't play the game in a different way, the Medic has a few full auto rifles too, the Support has a few guns that are excellent at close range, and the Assault can be used at medium ranges as well, but they still play out very differently.I was thinking that maybe Destiny 2 could have something similar, not necessarily weapon restrictions, but maybe buffs and nerfs for some types of weapon? I believe in game it's even stated that Titans are supposed to be the front lines, with Hunters supporting them, and I think Warlocks could be more of a ranged class. Now, of course you can use them that way, but maybe Bungie could provide some more incentive to play that way?I was thinking of giving the classes buffs and nerfs for the damage done by different weapon types. Not much either, probably around 4-8% or something like that? Either way, I'll write them all out, and would love some input on this, whether you like the idea or not, whether you would like weapon types to be swapped around, or whether this should all be fixed or be able to be modified with gear, or anything else too. | Titan | Warlock | Hunter- |-----|-------|------SMG | + | - | -Sidearm | + | - | -Hand Cannon | 0 | 0 | +Auto Rifle | 0 | 0 | +Pulse Rifle | - | + | -Scout Rifle | - | + | - | | |Sword | + | - | 0Grenade Launcher | + | - | 0 Shotgun | + | - | +Rocket Launcher | - | + | +Fusion Rifle | - | + | +Sniper Rifle | - | + | -Obviously there are other things that just damage that could be buffed or nerfed, like ammo reserves, reload times, or ability cooldowns. I hope that you like this idea though, and I hope that you like the general idea of this! I'm no game balancing expert, I'm just some guy with a laptop, an internet connection, and some opinions, but I would love for something similar to this to be implemented.What do you all think?",

Now I'm starting to wonder if I'm not aiming a little high and should just go with something that will fit my basic requirements: playing graphically **non**-intensive games in high quality (League of Legends, maybe some FPSs and RPGs), some photoshopping, regular internet browsing, and download/storage of digital media (movies, songs, etc).All this being said, would I be better off with a cheaper, pre-made system like [**this from Newegg?**](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboBundleDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1993936&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;nm_mc=EMC-IGNEFL110614&amp;cm_mmc=EMC-IGNEFL110614-_-EMC-110614-Index-_-Combo-_-Combo1993936-LM5A)My main desire here is for a computer that will be fast and comfortable to use for the next 5 or so years before having to upgrade again. Also some of the upgrades I made on pcpicker may look unnecessary but they're basically there in case I want to do more with my PC in the future, like get into heavier video editing or things of that processing nature.",

I just couldn't imagine Obama's AMA would be the case :D If you can't appreciate someone's actions without subscribing to their politics, that's not my problem, but it sure says a lot about your level of maturity.(Also, stating you're an A-male, a Pack Leader and all sorts of mucho titles, asking me not to call or text you again, and then when I don't (because seriously? you still think I give a shit?) *you* text *me* to whine about the lack of texting since I \"obviously don't care as much as you thought\" doesn't make you sensitive. It makes you a passive-aggressive manic depressive, or simply put, a loser.)The funny part is, I didn't really expect you to pay me back. Ever. Think of the facts, man. You are a 30-yo fattening up, balding guy living with his mother, totally attached to her, with no work *(though you lie profoundly about it, we all know you're unemployed)*, no real friends *(the few you have like me more than they like you)* and you spend your entire time playing computer games. It's been like that since I first met you... 4-5y ago. You say you hate Obama, that he is a commie/socialist and his politics have ruined your country... So how's that capitalism that you so fervently defend working out for you huh? Do you realize you're NOT part of the elite, and you never will be? Do you realize that I am younger, fitter, smarter, living in a country going down the drain, and *still* I've been steadily employed and make more money than you? Do you realize *you* borrowed money from *me*? And you tell *me* my life is not worth it?As for the excuse you found for not paying me back... whoring myself out/cheating? Because I *dared* to move on from you, God's gift to women, almost a year after we broke up?! Guess what, limp dick, that relationship was over long before we ended it, so my emotional attachment was 0 when you broke up with me. When you said your \"informant\" was my mother, a woman who hates your lying guts, a woman who fought me for months to dump you and -most importantly- a woman who can't speak proper English to save her life, I laughed loud. That was a class-A lie (for pulling it out of your Ass - hence shitty), and I'm not sure why, but seeing how pathetic you can be didn't make me sad, angry, or hurt; it just amused me.And now that I know I won't be getting my money back, a little inside info: I didn't cheat on you once, but I started seeing someone 2 weeks after we were over. And yes, that was right around the time you were begging me to take you back.All you have is your ego, but dear me, how fragile it is...",

Maybe I'm the problem because I can't transport myself to their world but at some point, I'd almost rather be shunned from society than live the way they live for such a ridiculous reason.  I suppose Notes From The Underground is more of a commentary on society but still.I guess there's a lot of \"class themes\" in older literature but in this case, I was overwhelmed by how society dictated the terms of the characters' lives, how much it troubled them and yet, how they were still obsessed with complying with society's rules.  The hate of society's rules combined with the strong desire to adhere to society's rules was tough for me to stomach.  I'd rather they accepted their role or just shut up about it.",

I felt fine about doing it, but only under the pretense of \"I'm shopping for my girlfriend don't I have such shitty taste lol??\" since I'm nowhere near coming out yet.The cashier was a woman who didn't seem super nice -- not mean, just not very talkative to the people who came through in line before me. But when I put my skirt on the counter and implied that it was for someone else (and I thought I was being cool about it), she immediately got really nice and we talked about the CD Walkman that I was also buying, never mentioned the women's clothing. And then, instead of bagging it in the typical translucent plastic bag, she got an opaque reusable bag from under the counter and used that. Didn't mention it, didn't charge me. And as I was walking out, she said goodbye and \"Stay out of trouble now.\" Which is such an odd and specific way to end a conversation. Later, I looked at my receipt and there was no item for women's clothing, just two that read \"electronics\". It all seemed like she was trying to help me \"cover my tracks\" and be covert. And she was so quick to not bring up the skirt in conversation, so that I would be comfortable. It might sound like a stretch, but it seemed like she was looking out for me. On top of all that, I would have guessed that she was transgender, although of course I hate to assume, and it was far from obvious. I dunno. Anyone ever have an experience like that? I didn't think I needed that but it made me feel really supported when it could have been awkward or difficult.In other news, I've been in girlmode in my house all night, and now I wish I could stay like this forever.

My mom has been stay at home my whole life and as nice as it was I really really wish she hadn't been, it would have forced me to do things for myself.

All said and done I have $120,000... over 6 figures and I live with my fucking parents and sit at home on reddit! I'm literally sitting here on my day off from work and I don't know what to do, where to go... I want to do something with my damn life.

He seems to have given up on life, I don't know how else to describe it. He still has a good job but doesn't seem to be doing too well and he's been getting in fights, at least 3 that I know of in this year. Earlier this year, he started a fight with a man who catcalled me when we were going out. And he also pushed a man because he startled him when all the guy wanted to do was ask for the time.My relationship with my brother has deteriorated over the years, and we decided to move out from our parents' old house a few months back because we couldn't live together anymore. After that, we've gotten along OK but a few days ago I dropped by his house to give him food I made for him and shouted at me that he just wanted a day alone without anybody checking on him, then immediately apologized and started crying.I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I can handle the two people I see the most be constantly at battle with themselves. My boyfriend mostly keeps to himself and the only major thing he does is he sometimes withdraws from physical intimacy, but my brother is on a spiral and I don't know if can do something.Is there something I can do?  ---     **tl;dr**: Both my brother and boyfriend are suffering anxiety from combat. My boyfriend is getting better and doing well but my brother is self-destructive and I'm scared for him. I'm confused, is there something I can do?",

Given that the game costs $10, or $20 with the expansion, I have half a mind to pick it up and play it once again. While I did enjoy it the first time around, it doesn't have quite the same effect on me as other games (mainly FF7) did on me - I've replayed FF7 from start to finish multiple times on a variety of platforms emulated since its initial Windows port back in 1998. The same can be said about Castlevania SOTN and Castlevania Aria of Sorrow, along with its DS sequel. On the other hand, I finished the original D2, and started on the expansion but never got around to finishing it, and I've never given it a second thought until Blizzard's recent announcement. Should I consider a second playthrough of D2? I'm not a big stickler for sound and graphics (if I were, I don't think I would be here!) but I don't want a library filled with games I bought but just left at the wayside. I already have enough of those on Steam as it stands.",

We haven't kept in touch, even though we live close to each other and often cross paths at the metro station. He stopped talking to me after I was accepted to a university in the same city as him. He recently blocked me everywhere on social media. At first, I didn't understand the reason behind this and I'm still struggling to figure out if it's my fault. I tend to blame myself, because I've neglected our relationship while I was striving to graduate with maximum grade.It's been a year now and I truly miss him. The last message I've got from him is when I've managed to reach out for an explanation. All he could say was \"I'm doing the best I can do for both of us\".I haven't been in a serious relationship since we broke up and I'm planning to stay single for a while. It seems like I can't get attached to another, because I still have feelings for him.I don't know what to do anymore. Should I wait for him? Should I insist more?**TL;DR: Been in a 2 and 1/2 years relationship, currently wanting to get back together with my SO, but not knowing how I should approach the situation.**",

		"text": "To start, you need to feed your tamed horse nether-stars. Like wolves, each time you give a tamed horse a star, there is a 1 in 3 chance it will become a wither horse, so you may need to kill a few withers to get this awesome pet!Once you have transformed your horse into an epic wither horse, you're pretty much done, just put on a saddle if you haven't already and begin riding.Wither horses are 2.4x larger than normal horses, like the size comparison to wither skeletons and normal skeletons. A wither horse is 3.4 blocks wide and long and is 3.8 blocks tall, so they take about a 4x4 space (4x5 if you are riding through a tunnel). (Here is an example image: http://imgur.com/pIveM84)A wither horse will have the default health of your original horse multiplied by 2.4, so if your original horse had 7 1/2 hearts, then the wither version will have 18, and if your original horse had 15 hearts, then the wither version of your horse will have 36 hearts.A wither horse's speed is 1.7x greater than the original's speed, so the same concept applies for speed as it does for health. So in this case, speed can range from 8.22375 Blocks per second to 24.67125 Blocks per second.Next up is swimming. one advantage these horses have is that they don't die in lava. Your horse can swim through 4 block deep liquids both lava and water, but 3 block deep lava in case you don't want to get set on fire.Wither horses are also able to \"trample\" entities. Trampling is when your horse is charging into entities and deals damage towards them, and knocks them back a few blocks. Depending on difficulty, a wither horse deals 2 1/2 hearts on easy, 4 hearts on normal, and 6 hearts on hard. Wither horses are also able to trample on top of crops and instantly turn farmland into dirt, but that can be toggled with /gamerule MobGriefing. You can also jump on top of entities, which deals a whopping 7 hearts of damage!Jumping with wither horses is also 1.7x greater than your original horse's jump height (Minimum is 1.5 blocks, Maximum is 9.5 blocks. Plus, wither horses can climb 2-block surfaces, so you would be able to climb-jump from a minimum of 3.5 blocks to 11.5 blocks!You can also heal your wither horse by feeding it nether warts. Each nether wart you feed your horse heals 1 heart.The only challenges players would have to face is digging large enough paths/tunnels for wither horses to travel in and make sure nether portals are large enough for them to go trough without suffocating. They also cannot wear armor.The reason I think this should be added is because it adds a bit more challenge to the game, and gives the player some more objectives. It also makes killing withers more valuable to players. I mean, you'd probably want to show off your awesome WITHER horse in Minecraft!",

(if so, links pls).And most importantly, if people did change from beta to alpha, how did your old friends (who knew your beta self) react? ",

The Republican looked across the restaurant and asked, \"Is that Jesus sitting over there?\" The waitress nodded \"yes,\" so the Republican requested that she give Jesus a cup of coffee, on him. The next patron to come in was a Libertarian, with a hunched back.  He shuffled over to a booth, painfully sat down, and asked the waitress for a cup of hot tea.  He also glanced across the restaurant and asked, \"Is that Jesus, over there?\" The waitress nodded, so the Libertarian asked her to give Jesus a cup of hot tea, \"My treat.\" The third patron to come into the restaurant was a Democrat on crutches.  He hobbled over to a booth, sat down, and hollered, \"Hey there honey! How's about getting me a cold mug of Miller Light?\"  He too looked across the restaurant and asked, \"Isn't that God's boy over there?\" The waitress nodded, so the Democrat directed her to give Jesus a cold beer. As Jesus got up to leave, he passed by the Republican, touched him, and said, \"For your kindness, you are healed.\"  The Republican felt the strength come back into his legs, got up, and began to praise the Lord. Jesus passed by the Libertarian, touched him, and said, \"For your kindness, you are healed.\"The Libertarian felt his back straightening up, and he raised his hands, and he to began to praise the Lord. Then, Jesus walked towards the Democrat, just smiling. The Democrat jumped up and yelled, \"Don't touch me ...

For anywhere between 55,000 won to 102,900 won, you get a total of 60 rides that are good for 30 days. This comes out to less than 920 won per ride if you're traveling within the boundary for Zone 1 - if I use an analogy with Seoul, this is within the city boundaries. This  is in contrast to the base fare of 1,250 up to 1,450 won per ride if you were to go from one end of Seoul to the other. If you live in the parts of Gyeonggi Province that have subway access and need to commute to Seoul, it comes out to less than 1,720 won per ride as opposed to the 2,750 won you'd pay to go from one end of Line 1 to the other. There are different fare levels depending on how far you live. For example, if you live near Bucheon station and work near Incheon station, you can get away with Zone 1 prices. Downsides:- No transferring from the subway to the bus. This is only for subway rides. - There is an exception for stations on the Airport Express line - no discount there even if you have a job at ICN. To my understanding, there's a separate commuter card for it. - You can't use your commuter card for that occasional trip beyond your zone **unless you want to pay dearly by forfeiting one or more of your allotted rides** (edit to reflect u/caodalt's comment). However, you can travel shorter distances than the maximum zone boundary. - Commuter cards with lower Zones may not be able to get on the Shin-Bundang line. **Summary: if you ride the subway exclusively (no bus to get to the station) to get around, save some cash by getting a monthly commuter pass. **",

Most of our schools are 1/3-1/2 ELL students, yet we have very minimal support for these students (1-2 full time ELL teachers, no associates, no curriculum, no ELL training for classroom teachers). Throughout my career we’ve been given very little guidance district wide. All the buildings do their own thing, we have NO district curriculum or common resources. Our district only cares about math and reading test scores. This has gradually gotten worse over the years. They love to implement something new to boost test scores, but then take no care in how that effects language learners. Currently I’m expected to basically “get kids on grade level” or “proficient on test scores”. I’m expected to cover hundreds of grade level common core standards (Reading foundations, comprehension, writing, language, listening, and speaking). But because my students are grade levels behind there are hundreds more from previous grade levels that also need to be covered. That’s in addition to teaching them just to speak. I have only 35 minutes with them per day. I feel like I’m drowning. I’m so overwhelmed with where to start, what they need, and what to teach that I just become paralyzed. I feel like I have no system and my lessons don’t flow in a linear way that is best to help my students catch up.  I have seven different levels of students and only 30 minutes four days a week to plan seven different lessons. I feel like a failure ever day. I’m seriously depressed and currently want to leave teaching (because there are tons of admin issues as well). ",

Because this will allow me to work 80+ hour weeks that will effectively quadruple my income, I said “sure.” Plus, it’s in a state that I’d like to check out.Then today, they send me my flight itinerary, and apparently they’re sending me out to a *totally different* store that I’ve previously helped. This store is managed by a psychopathic bully, and I absolutely hate her.When I saw that that was where I was getting sent, I immediately asked my district manager, who’s in charge of staffing the trip, if there was a mistake. He was just like, “Oh, yeah I guess that’s where we’re sending you. Is that all right?”Of course, I just said “Yes, I’m happy to help!” because 1) the company already bought my freaking plane tickets and rental car 2) I’m less than 24 hours away from boarding and 3) the company culture is such that you’re expected to “get along” or get out—especially if you’re in conflict with a superior—and I want to preserve my reliable, personable reputation.**I’ve posted about this bully before, and I believe some of those posts are still in my post history. But right now, I feel sick to my stomach. Like, literally ill. I’m dreading this trip. This manager is literally a narcissistic psychopath in every sense. She gaslights, screams, berates, scapegoats, throws things, and etc. And worst of all, she targets me. I remember working with her and feeling suicidal at times, due to her behavior.**It’s no surprise to me that her store needs workers to be sent out from several states away, because I’m guessing people have been quitting. I’m pretty sure the only reason she still has a job is that she’s very physically attractive (though kind of fat), and our company places a huge premium on hiring, promoting, and retaining physically attractive people (especially managers). It’s like an unspoken policy.Is there any way you can think of that I can diplomatically back out of this trip at this point? Again, I feel sick and really don’t want to put up with her bullying and abuse for two weeks. But I also want to preserve my reputation in the company as a reliable, personable team player.",

		"text": "For the longest time, I've had difficulty sustaining a meditation practice right when I wake up. Along with that, similar problems were faced with trying to exercise when I wake up, stretch, drink a substantial amount of water, go right to the shower, so on.Recently, the problem that I faced with consistency seems to have finally been solved.It's a breathing practice that I needed right at the start.Getting into the Wim Hof method, more specifically, has facilitated my ability to act on doing what I tell myself that I should do. For example, I did a set of the breathing exercise when I woke up, lying down in bed. Did another one after that, and it had given me enough of a boost to actually get up.From there, I went into a corner in my room, initially intending to do further sets, but instead found myself naturally drawn to doing some brief meditation. There was no sense of it being forced, no sense of discomfort or grumpiness that I usually get when I wake up. It all just felt...right.Getting out into the world after that felt a lot more bright and clear. Noticed a significant reduction in the usual brain fog and grumpiness that I usually have day to day. Purchased a coffee but felt no real need for one, and wound up only drinking half.If you're having trouble remaining consistent, take into consideration starting off your day with a breathing exercise. Could be Wim Hof's technique, could be anything else. Feel out what works for you.",

I keep thinking I know which type of license to pick, and then I get confused and doubt myself. They all seem very similar. Can anybody help a sistah out? Look below. Any questions, please ask. Thanks!Out-of-State ApplicantsWhat Type of License Should I Apply For?Out-of-state applicants seeking their first license in the State of Massachusetts could qualify for one of three (3) types of Academic PreK-12 educator licenses: Temporary, Provisional, or Initial. To figure out for which type you should apply for, consider the following:Do you hold a valid comparable license from another state and have you worked under it for three (3) years?If you answered \"yes\" to this question, you could qualify for a temporary license. A temporary license is valid for one (1) calendar year from the date of issuance. This enables out-of-state applicants to seek and obtain employment in the Commonwealth while they work to take and pass all required MTEL tests.Please note that passing all required MTEL tests or failed MTEL results will not qualify you for the temporary license.Do you hold a valid comparable license from another state and have you worked under it for three (3) out-of-the-past-seven (7)-years or have you completed one (1) of the following:A 'traditional' higher education state/jurisdiction-approved educator preparation program outside of Massachusetts?A state/jurisdiction approved 'alternative/non-traditional'educator preparation program and possess the equivalent of an initial license from that state/jurisdiction?An educator preparation program sponsored by a college or university outside of Massachusetts that has been accredited by one of the following: the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC), or the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP)If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, you could qualify for an initial license through the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC) Interstate Agreement. Massachusetts participates with every state and the District of Columbia through the NASDTEC Interstate Agreement for almost every license issued by the ESE Office of Educator Licensure. An initial license is valid for five (5) years of employment from the date of issuance in the State of Massachusetts.Please note that additional requirements may apply to this type of license and could include but may not be limited to:Passing all required MTEL testsEarning the Sheltered English Immersion Endorsements (SEI) – required for the following Academic PreK-12 licenses:Academic Teacher: early childhood and elementary teachers, teachers of students with moderate disabilities, teachers of severe disabilities, and teachers of the following academic subjects: English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, civics and government, economics, history, and geographyAcademic Administrator - principal/assistant principal, or supervisor/directorMassachusetts does not include the following licenses within the NASDTEC agreement: school psychologist, school nurse, or the speech, language, and hearing disorders teacher specialist.Have you completed all of the requirements in the previous question (#2) but do not hold the SEI endorsement? You may qualify for a Provisional license. The provisional license is good for five (5) years of employment.Did you get your Bachelor's and/or Master's degree from a DESE recognized accredited organization? To find out if your College or University is accredited by any of the DESE recognized organizations you can contact your institution directly or conduct a search yourself using the databases of the national accrediting organizations that are recognized by DESE.",

It also happened to be our anniversary weekend.  We made reservations at a nice restaurant on Saturday, got all dressed up, and then went out and had a great dinner.  Unfortunately, I got paged just as we were leaving, and got pulled into a call that lasted until around 2 in the morning.  The call then resumed at 10 am, and ended again at around 1 in the morning on Sunday.  I'm really pissed off partly because I didn't move my on call to accommodate for our anniversary, but because she was so excited about doing so many awesome things for our anniversary, and instead I got to sit in front of a laptop for 40 hours over the weekend.The part that makes me feel even worse is that she was so awesome during the entire thing, being supportive and bringing me food and giving me a massage when I was stressed out, and generally being the most perfect person on the planet.  She even cleaned the house when I was stuck on the call.I want to take her out to dinner or get her a spa day or something, but she works so much that it's nigh on impossible.  I honestly just don't know how to show her that she's been so amazing and that she was the best part of the weekend.

Specifically, I spend far too much time mindlessly clicking around online. \"Mental Masturbation,\" I suppose, would be a more fitting term for my main issue. And the internet is one Hell of an enabler.I may abandon this account for a while. That said, I've learned quite a bit from this board, but I will never realize the full benefits so long as I continue to use the internet how I am now. Tomorrow, I turn 25, and I have little to nothing to show for it. The first half of my 20s were a chaotic mess. My long-term mission now is to make the latter half more organized.Although I hesitate to use the term \"relapse,\" I will now be applying it to how I use the internet as this is my primary issue by far. My attention span is shot, my executive functions are destroyed, and the rebuilding process will take a while. I'd like to start reading books again and engage in activities that serve to build up my ability to sustain focus. But that cannot happen as long as I remain here.I've learned a lot about how to mitigate and channel urges, both mental and physical, but if you're reading this, be well-advised: slipping up is inevitable. Don't beat yourself up for it too much, you'll just reinforce your sense of defeat.I won't make another post until a significant amount of time has passed and I am in a better place. Until that time, I wish nothing but the best for all of you and hope you all succeed in achieving your goals.",

My Mom was a narassatic drug addict who abandoned me a lot and when she was around she would beat me and tell me I was a burden.My Dad loved me and told me I had even more of a responsibility to be a good person because I know how it feels to be hurt and to be used.I've always had this obsession with being in love and being loved. And it's never happened.1. First serious girlfriend was also a narsasstic drug addict who told me she only dated me because I bought her booze. She cheated on me and dumped me on her 21st birthday thru a text. Said she never loved me.2. This woman wasn't even my girlfriend but we dated for 2 years and she had been seriously fucked over by her ex so I didn't want to force her into some relationship but after 2 years of me clearly wanting to be her boyfriend and her clearly using me, she said she's seeing someone else for 6 months and she doesn't care how I feel. \"I don't love you and I never will\" is a sentence I wont forget.So a year after this and what do I have? Nothing. I've been on 14 first dates. Not one single woman wanted to see me again.I don't want to hate women. I am a liberal, I fucking hate \"The Red Pill\", Men's Rights and all that awful shit that is just anger aimed at women. Catcalling is fucked up, women are judged harshly over appearance, it's total bullshit that feminine products are taxed (and not even provided in jail). I believe victims of abuse because I understand being hurt and fearing the power the victimiser has.But I can't stop this feeling of hatered towards women. I've found myself calling women \"whores\" under my breathe and saying \"good serves her right\" when a woman is beaten up. I've started telling myself it's okay to hurt women because who care about a slut. Nobody cared when I was being abused and hurt. They went on with their lives and didn't suffer any negative consequences for their actions. So why be a good person? Especially to a group of people whose members have hurt me for no reason.Women don't owe me shit but why am I being hurt like this? Why can't ONE woman love me? And i have to see all my friends and family getting married, having children and they're just like me. Maybe a better job but they're just decent average people.I want to be someone to someone.tl;dr: woman have brutally hurt me and I'm becoming a misogynist but I know it's wrong and it's not who i want to be in life.",

We had had, I felt, good chemistry throughout two years I had been in her classes. I graduated nearly two years ago now, but am taking additional classes. After my Spring finals, on the last day I would see her in person, I gave her a small but well-thougnt out gift, and ask her out to coffee. She was very happily, and agrees right away. Between grading finals and getting ready for her trip back to her home country for the summer, she was going to be busy, and so we were to arrange a day by email. Unfortunately, nothing worked out, as she was leaving in less than a week.This Fall, I'm back at the college and taking the next class, in the same department and taught by a different teacher.

So I did what anybody with an hour to kill would do: I graphed inter-conference winning percentages by year dating back to 1998 to see which conference was the best.  I also looked at recruiting classes in the top 20 to analyze how recruiting affects performance.  I also also looked at out-of-conference play by individual teams to analyze how each team skews the data in favor of their conference. The assumption I am making in this post is the following: In order to determine the best conference, out-of-conference play will determine superiority.  Strength of schedule doesn't matter because we're looking at individual games, and in the first part of this post, I'm not going to care about recruiting rank (because if Northwestern beats Alabama, it shouldn't matter that Alabama has an exponentially better recruiting class, it's all about the rangz, Erneh), but I will address it later once we come to the conclusion of which conference is best.There will be lots of charts in this post, so if you like those, get ready.**Which conference is best?**To answer this question, I did the following two things: I charted each conference's winning percentage against each of the other conferences for the past 19 years.  I also charted each conference's out-of-conference winning percentage because it makes a good starting point.  So let's take a look at the graphs!  [This first graph is from 2013-2017.](https://imgur.com/Jflnzrk)  As you can see, everyone is more or less equal to each other, but the Big 12 is the \"worst\" conference the most. The SEC was surprisingly the best conference only once (in 2015).  Now let's look at the breakdown of each conference and their records against the other conferences.[ACC by Conference](https://imgur.com/JwqdR2I)[Big 12](https://imgur.com/TOSVMzt)[Big 10](https://imgur.com/nHZr3T1)[Pac 12](https://imgur.com/x03pMYs)[SEC](https://imgur.com/LtjsKxe)So, what do these graphs say?  With only 5 years of data, it's hard to extrapolate.  But we can clearly see a downward trend in the SEC.  The Big 12 goes in waves, but tends to be pretty competitive with the SEC.  They used to suck versus the ACC, but they've since gotten better.  The Big 10 is pretty consistently awful versus the SEC (but never manages to go winless), and has seen a definite upturn in the past 3 years.  The ACC was boom or bust from 2013-2015, but has become slightly more reliable against other conferences, but always tends to play the SEC pretty close.  One thing that I definitely noticed is that the trendlines for all conferences versus the SEC are very similar to each other insofar as no conference has gone winless against the SEC, even managing to keep it more or less around .500.  So let's go back even further to see if we can find anything.  The rest of the years are from 1998-2012.  For those of you playing the home game, 2012 was the last year of the Big East, so that makes the data more confusing if we lump it all together, so I've broken it up for your convenience.[Here is the graph of out-of-conference winning percentages, broken down by conference from 1998-2017](https://imgur.com/GMbxjn5).  Some things that immediately stick out that help verify the accuracy of this graph:* The Big East was really good from around 2000-2001 (when Miami was at its peak).* The Pac 12 dominanted 2005-2008 (Carson Palmer/Reggie Bush/Matt Leinart)* Michigan being not as good since around 2005 has really hurt the Big 10's winning percentages, reaching its valley during the RichRod/Brady Hoke era.* Auburn's resurgence in 2011 helped bolster the SEC to be good in 2010-2012.* Texas' performance pretty much drives the Big 12's performances (see: 2004-2005).* The ACC has never been the best conference by themselves (they tied with the Big 10 in 1999).So who's the best conference?  Doing the cumulative winning percentages, we get the following numbers:Conference | Winning Percentage-------------| -----------------------SEC | 54.7%Pac 12 | 54.1%Big 12 | 49.5%Big 10 | 48.9%ACC | 47%Big East | 45.2%So at first glance, the SEC as a whole is the most successful conference in terms of raw winning percentage.  Congratulations.But let's dig a little deeper.  What if the SEC is successful not because all of the teams are good, but because a certain subset of the teams are so good that they are buoying the records of the other teams to the point at which if those teams weren't there, the conference would be horrible?  This is definitely possible, and to figure out if this is the case or not, we need to look at the variance in winning percentage for the teams in each conference.  So let's do that.   Conference | Variance-------------| ----------SEC  | .018Pac 12  | .048 Big 10 | .015Big East | .038Big 12 | .0209ACC | .014I've calculated the variances for teams in each conference.  When the Big East folded, a bunch of teams moved across various conferences.  My rule is: if you move conferences, your inter-conference records still stand (because we're looking historically, not just when you were in the conference.).  This helps conferences like the ACC, who absorbed Miami and Virginia Tech, but hurts conferences like the SEC, who absorbed Texas Tech.  Variance is a useful stat here because it tells us which conferences are more evenly distributed: the lower your variance, the more even your record distribution is.  This means that the Big 10 is less likely to have really good teams boosting their record because their variance is lower.  However, conferences that have high variance are more likely to be kept afloat by really good teams who are dominant for so long.  One quick note on that Pac 12 variance stat: It's absurdly high because Utah is undefeated in out-of-conference play.  Granted, they've only played six games but they've really killed it.  If you remove Utah from their variance, it becomes a much more manageable .029, which falls more in line with the Big 10 and the ACC.So what does this tell us?  Well, it tells us that conferences like the Pac 12 and Big 12 are more unbalanced: they have a couple of teams with really good winning percentages, while other teams flounder around at the bottom.  Why not the SEC?  Well, it has to do with cluster variance.  2 of the 3 teams with the highest winning percentages come from the SEC (LSU, Georgia).  Even Alabama is tied for 5th highest winning percentage with Cal and TCU (technically Big 12 Nebraska is slightly better, but I'm not counting them in total winning percentage since their percentage has dropped since they've come to the B1G).  So 3 of the top 5 most successful schools are coming from the SEC.  However, they also happen to have one of the most unsuccessful schools (A&amp;M), and they have the fewest schools with out-of-conference records above .500 (5) (for comparison the ACC has 9!).  So basically, the fact that the SEC is essentially divided into tiers makes them have smaller variance: their good teams are REALLY good, their other teams are not so great, but they're both tightly clustered.  Furthermore, if you take out those 3 schools from the SEC, their winning percentage is 47%, which is the same as the ACC, but their variance is .006, less than half of the ACC.  This means that all these schools generally have poor out-of-conference records, and they tend not vary (i.e. they're being supported by LSU, Georgia, and Bama).  By comparison, most of the ACC schools are okay, and none of them are particularly bad.  The ones that are bad bring everyone down, but they still hover around .500 (with a little variance taken into account for the teams that perform the worst).  I would argue that this does affect overall conference strength, and what determines the best conference.  It's great for the SEC that Bama, LSU, and Georgia are great, but after that they taper off significantly.  Playing the ACC has historically been tougher because they have parity in their conference.  This also goes for the Big 10, who also has extraordinarily low variance despite having low winning percentage.So where does that leave us with who the best conference is?  It's hard to say.  Do I reward the rest of the SEC for the success of LSU, Georgia, and Alabama, or do I give it to the Pac-12 who has the next highest winning percentage (even though they have a lot of variance)?  I don't really want to give an opinion because presenting the facts is more fun than getting yelled at by the fan bases who I inevitably spurn.Here's another fun fact: [This is a chart of recruiting classes broken down by conference](https://imgur.com/KUQL6gu).  To get this data, I went [here](https://n.rivals.com/team_rankings/2018/all-teams/football) and broke down the top 20 schools into their conferences.  As you might expect, the SEC is dominating here (although less so recently).  Here's the fun part.  Let's take a look at [this graph](https://imgur.com/LtjsKxe) again.  This graph shows a definite downward trend in SEC performance over the past 5 years.  The correlation I drew here is that the SEC is playing worse with better players.  So even though they have better recruits, they are still eminently beatable.  I feel there is a narrative that the SEC has higher caliber players and while this might be the case, it does not seem lately to be transitioning to higher caliber play on the field.  Another fun fact: Texas A&amp;M showed up in 5 of the top 20 recruiting classes since 2011.  Their out-of-conference record since 1998?  8-22.  So do better players make the SEC better than everyone else?  I say no, and the fact that their record is consistently below .500 outside of their holy trinity makes me suspect that the SEC is actually worse as a result.  But again, that is just my opinion based on the facts I've presented.I hope you find this illuminating!",

This computer which sparked my love for gaming, PCs, and content creation with some of my finest work having been created with it has had many ups and downs. (specs in flair)It operated perfectly for maybe the first few years. I made stick figure animations, I played a lot of great games, I started making music, I obtained my love for the internet. Its first downfall, however, was when my GPU fan stopped working, so I needed to put a full desk fan blowing in my computer in order to keep the GPU from overheating. Due to the fact that my PC was located in my living room where my family is always at, I had to turn off the fan whenever they were watching something, so I couldn't play games as much as I'd liked to. You can only imagine trying to Skype with friends or record my voice was a bitch with everyone hovering over you. Porn was a no go either. :(It became increasingly dysfunctional as more and more spamware cluttered my HDD due to all of the programs and such that I downloaded. Windows Explorer crashed quite often (such is the nature of Vista). My video editing studio, Camtasia, was slow, crashy, and close to inoperable at times. I took initiative to clear my HDD of spamware and cluttered files in my PC one day which seemed to help a lot, but the functionality of my HDD was slowly degrading from there anyways.I started getting blue screens more often. Windows crashed more often. Programs crashed more often. Restarting Windows could take upwards of 30 minutes. To add insult to injury, over the summer my shitty 1280x1024 monitor gave out, so I had to start using my 720 40\" TV in the other room. Pixel density was awful, but at least I got to move my PC away from everyone. From here I really got into CS:GO and doing voice work on my channel ([my voice is quite low and sexy](http://youtu.be/PTpDEgGWFQk)). I met a group of people in a GO lobby which I made great friends with and have been Skyping with ever since. I enjoyed what time I had left with my PC and got a lot out of it I would say.But alas, this cheap piece of shit was never made to last.Today Windows would just not boot. I was blue screened out of the desktop and couldn't make it out of the motherboard BIOS. Windows recovery does show up if you jump through some hoops, but it won't actually get anywhere. I can't use a recovery disc because we threw that out long ago and it wouldn't matter because my optical drive is broken anyways. I don't know how to troubleshoot, quite honestly, but I'm going under the assumption that the Windows partition portion of my HDD has failed.So here I am, brothers, a 16 year old boy, computerless. I'm sure that if I took the time to get a new HDD and a new copy of Windows Vista, I could continue using my PC, but that's so not worth it. All I have to stay connected is my shitty Galaxy S2 with a broken power button. My family doesn't have the money to drop so much as $300 to build a basic PC (nor would I ever let them buy pre-built again), so it's up to me to save up for it. I was recently dropped from my job that gave me shit hours anyways, so I must first find a new one and go from there. I'd like to save up a lot and build something truly marvelous, but realistically I'll probably drop upwards of $750 on a PC to make something still-quite marvelous. Wish me luck. :)",

I use music to pump my workout, listen to music when I am feeling down, while I study, just whenever it's quiet. So I guess I am looking for some lesser known artists or songs that fall into those categories. I will be looking through some of the older posts just to get a look at what others are listening to.Like I said, Top 40 makes up the majority of my tastes, but I also really enjoy bands like Bastille, The Neighbourhood, Icarus Account, Lana Del Ray, club beats,  I do like Dubstep but don't even know the names of the songs, Imagine Dragons, I will honestly listen to anything at least once all the way through.If this sort of post is frowned upon in this sub, I apologize, I am just looking to graduate to adult status when it comes to music.",

Maybe they’ve figured the dust is settling, and I’ve gotten the space or something I needed. But really what I think I want is for friends  to just act normal.

I will explain in more detail what I mean by this.With all this talk of high-SMV, it's probably *very* easy for those who didn't get externally validated in their youth to see themselves as lesser in contrast to higher-SMV people. This is especially true with women, the fat chicks won't only just look up to the prettiest girls but they'll actually *see themselves as lesser* in comparison to them. And unfortunately it's true with men too, although more subtle.That Alpha-Chad who gets all the pussy and is liked by most people will make you feel insecure, and insecurity is a nasty feeling. When you're around high-SMV guys you'll subconsciously change your behavior, for example with your own buddies you'll joke around and give them a bit of shit/banter, as guys do - but with guys like Alpha-Chad, it's possible that you find yourself censoring yourself around him. Same with high-SMV girls, you censor yourself. **This is because you are unknowingly seeking their validation, and want to please them**Through meditation I have been able to recognize that I act different around high-SMV girls and guys. I censor myself more to make myself more agreeable, mostly because I'm trying to please them. **This is classic beta behavior**. What has helped me fight this, aside from being conscious of it, is to **recognize my own worth**. For guys who read this sub a lot the term 'SMV' might begin to plague you rather than help you. Yeah it's good to improve yourself but **do not view high SMV people as better than you. Yes, they may have an easier life than you, but that doesn't mean they're worth more as human begins. We're all human begins at the end of the day, we're only here for so long and on the grand scale of things we're insignificant, use these facts to free yourself**Sure, that male-model is going to get more pussy than me, and he's going to have more people like him, but that doesn't make his life more valuable than my own. The more I have begun to internalize this, the more I feel that I am beginning to feel 'true' confidence/frame. The mindset you should have is ''You could have more money than me, be better looking than me or even be better than me at everything, I don't give a fuck. You don't influence my frame''**So how do you internalize your own worth?**- Meditate everyday so you are conscious of your people-pleasing tendencies and thoughts of inferiority- Use affirmations to counter-act it while meditating, tell yourself that you are not worth any less as a human being- Also acknowledge that high-SMV people have problems too. They're not gods, they're human beings who have their own shit to deal with. That hot girl who makes you sweat probably has anxious thoughts whenever someone doesn't like her profile picture, that's not really a big problem but knowing it can free you of having this pre-conceived notion that they have some godly power, they don't",

		"text": "I'm sure that many people are aware of the benefits of removable cords, and why you should take care when wrapping cables, but in case there are people who haven't been in this hobby for a long time, I figure I'd share a quick story.Yesterday, I walked out of my house with a perfectly functioning pair of Audio-Techica ATH-IM70 IEMs. I listened to them during my train ride, and when I got to my destination, I wrapped them up, put them in a separate case, and did what I had scheduled to do.A few hours later, I was done and now that I was alone, I took them out to listen to my music. To my surprise and distress, the left side was totally silent. This meant that one or some or all of the following was the case:- The cable was busted.- The left earbud was busted. - The source was busted. My primary music source is an iPod Nano. I unplugged from my iPod and re-plugged my IEMs into my iPhone and played a track saved in my phone. No dice; left side still quiet. That meant my iPod was quite fine, meaning the problem was with the IEMs. I decided to put my IEMs away and figured I would try a spare cable I have at home (the cable I was using up to that point was a first-party cable with an in-line mic, which I bought the day I bought the IEMs; the IEMs originally came with a cable that had no mic). Once I got home, I got the original, very much unused cable and re-attached the buds to the cable. Lo and behold, both sides played just fine. So that highlights why removable cords matter. With the immediate problem solved, I took a closer look at the left part of the cable and found a tear: http://i.imgur.com/JBmAO6J.jpg. This made me believe that I was wrapping my cable wrong the whole time I had it; every time I wrapped the cable, the cylindrical part was causing the cable to bend harder, and repeated bending lead to the cable getting frayed and disconnected. Lesson learned - make sure that the cable does not bend with any hard parts against it when wrapping them up for storage. And don't wrap them too tightly. tl;dr - removable cables are good because you can save the more critical buds (assuming the buds are fine), and wrap the cable gently. ",

Before I muted her, she was spamming thumbs up and the laugh emote.Knowing that the worst case scenario for this player is that he has to wait 60 seconds to que into a game for two-five games is really a bummer.  Why is there no actual, real ban system in this game like there what's been implemented in other MobAs?  That shit right there would get you banned for an entire week in LoL, and chronic offenders would just be plain permanently banned.  Is it something the devs are working on and intend to implement at a later date?",

I don't know what's wrong again, everytime I play more than one or two games a day I lose the majority of it. If I play 2 games a day I come out with distinct more wins than losses. But if I dare to play more than 2 games per day I probably end up losing at least one game more than I won at the day. In the week this would be like 5-10 losses over wins, I created some statistics for myself. I'm playing on my smurf atm with 84-49 stats and I lost 8 games over the past 3 days while I only won 2 games. I also remember that I had to play a sh*tton of games to get over 100 wins over losses on my main. I don't know why this is trying to get you to 50% W/L for ALL of your games? It should try to balance EACH GAME out and not your whole wins and losses. I know that many people will say that I may be the reason but the lost games are usually decided by a feeding mid and/or top and a jungler who is literally the worst. Last game for example I had a Jax jungle who didn't do a SINGLE GANK until 20th minute. Rengar lost top because Lee ganked and he didn't get any ganks, my botlane was also pretty f*cked because Lee ganked bot (lanegank). I also had to dodge my last match because a Duo was 1st and last pick. They decided to pick mid and AD and force me as 4th pick to play support. I don't like being FORCED to play a role I don't like, ESPECIALLY not when they are PREMADES and I'm 4th pick. As the summoners code says pick order goes over roll calling or anything different but why are they even able to change roles like this and troll over the rest of the team? It's pretty frustrating that you lose so many games without other reason than bad teammates. I can't always win botlane so hard that I can carry when mid and top lost hard or my jungler is never ganking. GreetingsA very frustrated Elessar",

However, and I am starting to realize this more now than ever before, it's just been memorization (From tutorials, books, docs, stack overflow.) There have been very few times where I solved any given programming challenge with my own brain, I always used other peoples solutions. It's not the case that I too lazy to come up with my own solutions, no, believe me I try really hard not to resort to someone else's code, I am just unable to solve problems in my own code.For instance, one day I needed a password generator for a project I was working on. I spent a while trying to put a generator together with no apparent success, so guess what I did, I googled for an already written password generator. I mean this is pretty some pretty basic shit that you'd think someone who's been writing code for 3.5 years would able to do.Does anyone have any advice?

Any help with common, tasty yet more sophisticated (stronger too) drinks would be very appreciated. Even a website to help me figure out my taste would be great.Stuff I like:- Most all wines, but I feel like I need to \"man up\" when I'm out and never order them. Any good wine cocktails that aren't watered down / have a decent addition of liquor in them?- Dark, bitter ales, but I'm sick of beer.- 2 parts liquor 1 part soda would be ideal, but something even stronger and tastier would be great. Sadly one of my favorite drinks is the Fuzzy Naval (Vodka, peach Schnapps, OJ), but I have that pride issue where I feel it's too froo-froo.- Had a *lot* of fun with salt + Patron shot + lemon / lime the other night. Might try those some more in the future!- Another drink I just got turned on to was a Whiskey Sour, and I'd definitely like to expand my Whiskey cocktail choices. Again, expanding beyond a 1 liquor 1 soda into a 2 + 1 is ideal.Sorry if this is vague, but I'm not sure where or how to pursue this.",

Obviously you're not gonna pay directly with gold at the grocery store or anything like that.EDIT: So I should've clarified, I meant buying gold as a way to preserve wealth, rather than actually make new money, as you would with stocks/bonds.  I looked at some gold ETF's, but they all have expense ratios.  This is fine for stocks, but the idea is that gold will hold the same value over time relative to the dollar.  So if they're annually taking away some of your holdings, you are losing a little bit of value over time.  ",

The floors are in ok condition, there are certainly scuffs but the boards are tight there is no squeaking. None of the boards need to be replaced. There are two rooms (roughly 13' x 11') and a small hallway that we would like to refinish, and I'm also considering ripping up the living room carpet and salvaging that. The living room is far worse than the other rooms, I think it would definitely need to be sanded. So for my questions:We would like to do this ourselves, but have no clue what the price range would be for this project. Any idea about what it might cost? The wood is currently a pukey brown, are we limited to only going darker in color? I have a large dog and although I cut his nails regularly I worry that he will grip on and ding the floors. Someone I work with told me doing 2-3 coats would prevent that from happening, is that true? Any other advice? Thanks!",

For a woman that had turned her back on mankind and didn't want to be a part of the world for 100 years, he told her it would be OK again to be who she is and to do what she believes in, no matter what others say. He twisted Lex beyond rational constraints. He demonified him without going overboard, and brought out the vicarious evil within the character. Not even the almighty John Williams did that. He redefined the idea of a human with too much time on his hands that could not only bring a god down to his knees, but bury him single handedly.He brought the sound of rage and war with Zod, and his one note terror campaign was immensely powerful. He made us believe that the fanatic would do whatever it takes to demolish Earth as his final act.He made the Joker as much as Ledger did. When we hear that horrible, unnerving sound of a cello tightening, it provides a sickening allegory for the strings inside us contorting as he enters the room.

The first few months I worked there, when we did annual reviews I was still very new so my first raise was only 5¢ so I was like okay fair enough.

The salary is good, there's a lot of paid time off, co-workers are nice and the company treats employees well, with morale being very high. The office is in midtown Manhattan, there are good opportunities for advancement and career growth, a lot of young people work there, it would look fantastic on my resume, etc. I graduated from college last year and have worked a few decent jobs in different fields (not in NYC) and I'm still young (22 years old.) The problem I'm enduring is that my new job includes A TON of social interaction and walking around and meetings, etc. My problem is I suffer from severe social anxiety disorder that I've swept under the rug my whole life because until now, it never effected me in a way where it felt like it hurt my future/work performance. (In college/other jobs, I was able to make a few friends and get by ok without my anxiety becoming something that would effect performance.)In moments where I don't feel anxious, I've always been charismatic and been told I have great people skills. But as I've gotten older, those moments have been more and more rare. It started when I was younger I would only get anxious in certain moments that seemed common for a lot of people at younger ages (around a good looking girl, talking to an adult/authority figure, etc.) and it's slowly taken over my life to the point where I feel anxious all the time, even around family.In the week that I've been working at this new company, my anxiety has already clearly effected my performance and ability to adapt to the job, and people are noticing that I'm nervous/anxious already. I feel like this opportunity has really brought me to a place where I finally realize I'm going to need to get help if I'm going to be ok in life long term. I need to address my issues through therapy or other means in order to be able to succeed in any career and also in life in general. I do have decent self esteem in terms of I think I'm smart, not ugly, etc. and feel like I could be really successful in life (I mean, even with my anxiety I'm doing better than a lot of my friends.)But I'm worried I may never get an opportunity like this again. My major in college was communication (very hard to find work) and I don't want to leave an incredible opportunity like this but I really feel like things will only get worse for me mentally as I stay and I won't be successful at work anyway because of it. With my commute to work included, I'm pretty much not home from 7 AM to 7 PM every day so not much time to address issues outside of work during weekdays.There's also the pressure of when my family and friends ask me why I would quit something like this. I'm not comfortable talking to people about my anxiety, I've never told anyone in my life. Most people just assume I'm \"awkward\" when nervous because they don't really even know what social anxiety is or don't make the connection. Would I be stupid to leave this job behind and regret it? Or am I just repeating the same mistake I've been making for years by staying and not addressing my problem? Should I try to stay at the job somehow and address my problems at the same time? It's a tough decision, and even though I'm still only 22, I see plenty of people older than me with better resumes and skill sets struggling to get a decent job or wasting away for a low salary at a company they hate. I would hate to be like that in 5-6 years and be looking back on this job that I left.",

Just a short moment ago, I reached 98. Now, a mentally healthy person would be able to go \"ah so close! Soon I'll get there!\"Not for me.My reaction instead was one of overwhelming anger and wishing that I had done worse because, for the life of me, I cannot tolerate that feeling of coming very close to a goal but being off by just a bit.This has also happened in college. When I failed a class, I was around three points off. A mentally healthy person would say \"damn, wish I passed.\"Not for me.My reaction was \"if I fail, then I should fail the right way. I wish I did worse and failed by several, rather than just a few points.\" I would have functioned better knowing that I failed with, say, a 38/100 rather than a 58/100. At least I would have \"failed well.\"The most fucked up thing about what happened earlier? The one thing calming me down mentally, is telling myself \"well hey, at least you didn't get 99 lines, then you'd be one off from 100.\" And it's true, that would have made my mood far worse. I derive a distorted sense of comfort in that.Unfortunately, I cannot get by like this. This mentality has consistently destroyed me and when I think that I have it under control, it comes back stronger than ever.Either I'm perfect as a success, or I'm perfect as a failure. No in-betweens, no middle ground, just all or nothing. Mentally I cannot fathom any other way.",

		"text": "I wanna start off by saying firstly I really do love the team. I always have been a fan, and am currently a rookie season ticket older at the age of 20. I grew up watching this team in the glory days. Williams, Bibby, Jackson, Christie, Peja, Webber, Vlade, Hedo, all those guys were studs and we were robbed in 2002. Anyways, as much as I loved that team, I feel embarrassed that all the Kings ever seem to talk about is the past... if you follow the Kings on any social media - FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, you should know exactly what I mean.To me, it is pathetic, that all we can talk about is that 4 year span from 1999-2003. I love that team, but do we really have to constantly bring them up? Like yesterday I believe was Jason Williams Wednesday... It just becomes ridiculous after some time. I don't see other teams talk about their past as much as we do. There was a video posted on the Kings YouTube channel about fans reminiscing about ARCO Thunder... How sad is it that we fans have to reminisce? It's a weekly thing too. All us Kings fans really ever do is talk about back when we were good for a quick minute... Now, I know the Kings don't really have much else to talk about, and that's why it bugs me. Don't you want to see your team succeed and have something new to talk about? Of course you do. I love that era of ours but I'm getting tired of talking about it and constantly seeing the past brought up. I want to focus on the now for once. But we suck. So we don't have anything to talk about. As owners, players, coaching, wouldn't that motivate you? I guess I'm kind of just complaining that here we are again, in another shitty season with no sense of direction. 9th year in a row with no playoffs. It bugs the hell out of me, and the passion we as fans express, certainly is not being treated equally by the ownership group / players. All we really do have is the past, and I hate it. All we ask for is the 8th seed, seriously. Is that too much to ask? Or even just a sense of direction. No one knows what's happening. There is no transparency in our organization. - one frustrated Kings fan. Ugh.",

The idea of giving back just sounds so great to me :) So I have recently kicked off, and although I frequently watch podcasts and know what I like, I'm curious what you all like (or dislike) about them? So far my podcast \"agenda\" has been FOs, WIPs, general knitting/crocheting/yarn talk (things I'd like to knit, quesions/discussions, needles, etc.), I briefly spoke about my shop and yarns, and ended with a bit of a life update. This is what I like to see in podcasts - just nice and easy going, but I also spoke for a solid 55 minutes! And it was easy to talk for that long, haha. I have seen feedback that people don't like to hear about podcasters lives, so I put that last so anyone who wasn't interested could skip it. So, what do you guys look for in podcasts?",

Basically they were trying to make us lower our price even further. This kept going on for a few days and each day they would bring over a new relative of theirs to try and explain to us to do it there way. Today was the last straw however. They finally went to the mall office and asked them to see the design and since they had been bothering them a lot they told them that they would do it when they had the time. They then come to us and tell us that they need it 10 days before the deadline. We said ok but it would cost them more. They said that we are taking advantage of them when were clearly were not. If you want something faster you have to pay more so that we can get better shipping on the supplies. We finally told them that we would like to stop the process until they get a better attitude about this. Did we do the right thing?

Either one or both of them have done the kind of things horrible parents do:  physical abuse, verbal abuse, refusing to work so we ended up very poor unnecessarily, forgetting to pick me up for our time together after their divorce, putting me in the middle of their divorce, moving away when I was 14, cursing out my friends' parents for things that aren't even true, borrowed money from me as an adult and didn't even pretend to try to pay me back, etc.  I can go on forever as the list is everything but substance abuse and anything more than a night in jail despite calling the cops on each numerous times.  I don't think I have a single positive memory with my mom and she once told me she didn't love me.  I have some good memories with my dad but I'm talking about a guy who moved us into a house with a drug dealer because he was dating the drug dealer's mom.  There are definitely worse childhoods than mine but the people that know my parents cite me overcoming them as something they respect and are impressed by.I moved on my own a month before I turned 18 and have been 100% responsible for myself since.  I'm 33 now.  I have a master's degree, a CPA license, absolutely amazing friends, I'm fit and I make very good money.  I'm very lucky.  Life is good and I'm so grateful to be in the position I am in.My issue is that when I speak to them (by phone because neither lives within 800 miles of me and have never visited me once despite me living near the town where I grew up in), they're both sad, miserable, broke, unhappy and alone.  I don't think either one of them has a single thing they're happy about in their lives right now and in some ways it makes me sad.  I know they made the choices that put them in this position, neither are trying to improve their lives and I can't let them destroy me like I did when I was a kid but they're my parents so I'll always love them.I guess I feel conflicted between hating them, loving them, understanding that they had to reap what they sowed eventually and even some guilt because I'm so happy and they're so sad.  This doesn't keep me up at night, it doesn't make me cry, I actually don't think about them often all but when I talk to them I don't know how to feeltl;dr My parents suck and I don't know how to feel now that I've made my own life.",

We learn what works and what doesn't and adjust ourselves to make the best possible decisions.I feel like, for my entire 25 years of life, there's been very little I was sure about. I always thought it was healthy to consider my options, pick one, but stay open-minded in case I was wrong. At some point staying open-minded became an inability to adhere to one thing. Whether I'm switching between games because one is too difficult or frustrating or trying to decide what to do for dinner, I struggle to decide and stick to something.But more than that, when asking the hard questions and being introspective, I feel like I can't even trust my own judgment about myself. Or rather, I'm the least qualified to judge myself due to bias. But it's a terrible idea to only go off others' opinions of what you should be doing or feeling because they're not going to have all the facts.So I'm wondering how many other people do or have struggled with this in the past, and some ways I can learn to either trust my judgment or hone it down so I can one day.

This has been particularly bad whenever I am drinking, smoking, or using psychedelics (which I don't do frequently). I also am afraid of going to sleep at night and the dark. I used to think I just had a really bad fear of death, but my fiance and I came to the conclusion that it's not death itself that I'm afraid of, but what comes after. After a lot of self-reflection and introspection, I've realized that I'm absolutely terrified of being separated from my perceived 'self,' aka my physical body and my thoughts in my head. This is why the idea of dying scares me. I am terrified of being separated from my \"home base\" if you will, whether something comes after or not. This is also why I'm uncomfortable meditating or doing drugs/drinking alcohol. The second my mind starts to quiet and I start to sort of feel like I'm \"leaving\" my body, I start to panic. I feel like I lose myself and cease to exist. Thinking thoughts and being aware of my physical body makes me feel safe for some reason. I am so uncomfortable with not being completely in control and in my body/head. It feels like I cease to exist or am not safe when I venture out of these spaces. When I meditate, sometimes I feel a type of astral projection (or something similar to it) and immediately feel scared and pull myself back to attention in my physical body. I have a horrible phobia of being alone floating in space or the ocean for the same reasons. I wish I knew how to get through these feelings because they are at the root of all of my anxiety and depression.",

I cried all morning and I've cried at least 3x at work.  I know there are women who take much longer than one month.

I'm super angry at people who told me that I had nothing to worry about, because now I'm seeing this as a foreboding sign that this will be a long hard road for me.  I'm angry at everyone who told me to \"just relax\" and stop stressing out so much, when there's been ZERO evidence that anxiety and stress cause infertility.It seems like everyone on every pregnancy board got pregnant the first month off the pill.  And looking at statistics, more people get pregnant in month 1 than any other month...so I feel like even though it's just my first month, my chances have tanked.  It almost seems like the fertility world is made up of people who get pregnant immediately, and people who take years and need medical intervention.  No in between.  And I can't afford medical intervention.My husband barely seems to care.  I'm devastated.

He kept his cat's litterbox in the other bathroom, so he could have one to himself. The apartment had good natural light, but it never got too hot. Norman's rent was reasonable, his landlord was friendly, and there was always free coffee in the apartment office lobby. The complex was largely white-collar, so crime was low. Still, Norman sometimes thought longingly about owning a home. The next time he went to the grocery store, he picked up a booklet with local house listings. There were lots of nice houses in the area in his price range. He dogeared some of the pages and made an appointment with a realtor. He was excited. The next day, Norman came home to find a pipe under his sink had burst, and water was all over the floor of his kitchen. He called the apartment office and they sent a repairman up within minutes, who fixed the leak in an equally short time, suctioned up the water, and said he'd be back at Norman's earliest convenience to replace any damaged linoleum. Norman was impressed at the efficient service, and told that to the repairman, because Norman always liked to hear when he had done quality work. The repairman smiled and said, \"and it's completely free for you! That's the great thing about living in an apartment!\" Norman put the listings booklet in recycling. He decided he liked living in his apartment. It had two bedrooms, so it didn't feel cramped. His rent was reasonable, his landlord was friendly, there was free coffee in the lobby, and he had lots of natural light. ",

Kinda want to get this done because I have bad dust allergies and my house smells a little bit, so I figured I'd look into a few air quality control methods.  Since the duct work is so old, I'd love to do that first.I've talked to one company who wants to use a Diesel Dump Truck.  It basically sucks all of the dust out of the air vents, but doesn't actually scrub them.  That will cost me $395, and I can also have them disinfect the ducts for another $125.A friend of mine said there are machines that do a much better job called Rotobrush machines that basically scrub the shit out of your air ducts, disinfect/sanitize them, clean the grates, etc.  Seems like it would be a lot more expensive.Anybody who knows a little bit about this industry - is it worth doing something more extreme like Rotobrush?  Or is just sucking the dust out of the vents and disnfecting it good?  And what should I expect to be charged for this?  I have 1 return and 10 vents.  Any help would be appreciated - thanks!",

I graduated high school a little over half a year ago and I went straight into community college during the summer.  I got a job during the fall but it barely lasted a month because apparently corporate doesn’t care about their stores and significantly reduced funding to my campus’s store. In result, the managers put literally half of the associates on standby and I haven’t been assigned a shift since September. When I got my first check ever, my nparents fucking stole it straight out of my bank account and used it for something else. They promised to pay me back but they never did and it seems like they have no intention to ever pay me back which makes me fucking livid.  I’ll save the rest of this incident for r/raisedbynarcissists. During Christmas break, I decided to download tinder and got a few matches right away. While using the app, I realized that I needed money if I wanted to take these girls on dates. I’ve been hesitant to msg my current matches because of the fact that I’m broke. Not only am I broke, but I drive a car that’s in bad condition (paint chipping off, can’t turn on the ac or else the engine will make a loud squeaking noise etc). The car is almost as old as me and the interior/exterior proves me right. I fear that this will turn girls off. Should I even try? I’d also like to add that I have never dated anyone. Thanks ",

Each one of these blocks should have a color ID which is the same as dyed armorHow do do this?:- I would copy the source code of leather armor that colors the textures and copypaste it into the wool, glass and hardened clay block code.Why do this?:- It would be beneficial to a lot of mapmakers. It would make building a lot more complex with a wider variety of colors you can use.Fixing issues:- Q: Well, what about the names of each type of wool?  A: The wool should be named as (x) (y) wool, x being the color first in the color chart, so red would be first, and y would be the last, which would be brown. example: \"Orange Lime Wool\", \"Red Brown Stained Glass\" and \"Green Purple Stained Clay\"- Q: What about colored sheep?  A: Sheep can have their own IDs too, even today they have unique IDs for primary dye colors. The new sheep IDs should be based off the dye graph, and '''NOT''' by a specific name like 'yellow' or 'brown'.The downsides:- There are none. :)If it works with items it would most certainly work with blocks too.",

I completely believe that 95% of the time it is not coming from a place of negativity or maliciousness, but we see when your girlfriends are there for the show. On the other hand is physical space. Clubs are buildings. Buildings have occupancy limits. Also included in physical space is the astonishing lack of awareness and consideration that women (and I am absolutely including the lesbians in this generalization, but that is a whole other rant) have at the gay bars. Your girlfriends are guests to our space. I am a pretty tall dude with some gangly-ass limbs, and I don’t carelessly knock into others at near the rate that these party girls do. Whenever I get bumped hard or pushed or elbowed, it is ALWAYS women. Except for the very few times when it’s men (hows that for a stat lol?). I get it, the club is packed, alcohol is flowing, it happens. But it’s like they literally don’t even realize that they just made contact with someone else, it is almost never acknowledged. And back to that occupancy thing for a second. Guess who all those straight women attract. I know you all are smart fellas, that’s why I love this sub, but I just don’t think it is thought about how actions have reactions. And trust me, I’m that gay guy that you all love to talk shit about because I ogle all the hot straight guys that come to our clubs searching for women (or they were dragged along with one of the girls you invited), but it is too much. I’m there to dance with friends and not necessarily to hook up, but this was the first time at the gay clubs (I haven’t been to one in about a year before two weeks ago) where I did not feel that carefree, “go hit on a dude” atmosphere. It was very likely that it was going to be a straight guy. And as more straight guys come, there is an influx of straight guys there solely to get some pussy. It’s one thing if your straight friends are actual allies and them scoring at the club is just a nice bonus. But lately there seems to be a lot more “predator” type guys there that show visible disgust and disdain for the gay activities happening and are just there to hunt for easy chicks. A very informal survey, but I took tonight to keep track of the couples that I saw and here are my results. I’m hoping to get published. There were a total of three gay or lesbian “couples” on the floor (as in they were paired off to the point of making out). There were 11 straight couples doing the same. That is bonkers to me. I feel bad because this post kind of sounds like I hate women or like I feel that there should be no straight people allowed at the clubs. That isn’t the case. There is just a very tangible shift in culture from being away from the bars for so long to coming back. Maybe it’s indicative of a positive change of acceptance in society and I’m just a grumpy bitch who didn’t get any dick. Who knows.Tl;Dr: please read it I typed it all on my phone. But basically we should make all breeders wear special wristbands and they should need a gay sponsor to get into the club.",

But I do want to add a few cards and wanted to use this opportunity to discuss some choices.[[Daxos of Meletis]]This card seems like goodstuff at first, but hear me out- this is all about politics. It's cheap, so it can be played and donated by turn 6 without ramp. You can use it to get ahead in cards, or you can give it to an opponent and let them hit you. It's 2 damage, 1 card, and 1 life per hit. Ideally you'd want something to exile permanents you own to make up for an opponent gaining a Niv-Mizzet or Avacyn but all the same- they at least need to kill you last.speaking of exiling...I've seen [[Venser, the Sojourner]] in a few builds. I see the allure, and in a defensive deck you should be able to build him up to ultimate fairly easily. His first ability is either useful or not at all, but his second is.[[Tamiyo, the Moon Sage]]Primarily she'll be controlling the board, but is one dude per turn enough? She can also draw cards and her ultimate is great as well. This is a tough one.[[Jace, Architect of Thought]]Again, somewhat useful but maybe more marginal abilities. Primarily we want to be drawing cards and deflecting damage with him but that doesn't keep him alive long. For four mana we want more. His + ability is decent, but is it decent enough?[[Djinn of Infinite Deceits]]That dang non-legend clause. Plus he has to survive a turn. For 6 mana I usually find myself holding onto him than playing him.General CounterspellsPacking one [[Pact of Negation]] has been worth it. And since I'm holding back mana anyway it doesn't seem like a stretch to throw in Spell Crumple and Dissipate as well. I'm open to any suggestions for cuts from my deck, and appreciate any help.

Azen was a force to be reckoned with, routinely defeating nearly everyone other than Ken in his prime. Throughout Melee's history, he has managed to place well even into the reign of Mango and Mew2King. Though he has \"retired\" from Smash multiple times, each of his returns has shown incredible results - from his solid singles placing and fantastic teams performance at Pound V, to his utter domination of the 6/3 installment of Xanadu and later impressive 5th on 8/19. Even in 2014, Azen is clearly a natural.My question is: what do you think would happen if Azen were to return for real? We have seen players like PC Chris and KoreanDJ perform well even after long hiatuses, but none of them seems to \"get\" Melee in the same way that Azen does. With a fair deal of new tech to learn and a much deeper metagame, could Azen still be a threat today?",

		"text": "It seems that there are some character types that are almost ubiquitous in manga and apparently have existed in it for many decades, with too many common details to just be reinvented independently every time. Some examples of those character types:* A teenage boy with an outgoing personality, who hates injustice with a passion. Even if he's not actively a hero, he can't stand still seeing an injustice happening. it is not a good idea to hurt a kid or a woman in front of a character like that. If a woman is in trouble in front of the character, he will jump in to protect her, no matter who she is and no matter if he actually stands a chance to avoid getting hurt. A common exchange is \"-why did you do that? -my body just moved on its own\". An example I can thing of could be Shirou from Fate/Stay night, but there are definitely more going back many decades.* A young male, could be between 10-25 years. Bighearted, loyal, energetic, but not particularly smart, except for extreme situation where it is about saving or protecting someone. Often has got some kind of natural gift, like extreme endurance/stamina/persistence. Very protective of friends. Big appetite. Most obvious example is Goku from dragonball, but it is definitely not the first one.* A girl who grew up together with the main character, practically since infancy, and is in love with him to his utter obliviousness, not helped by the fact that she alternates between trying to deny it or trying to tell him about it but not being able to due to shyness, while he remains completely oblivious to all of it and just considers her a good, if not best friend. A common stereotypical demonstration of this is a scene of her routinely visiting him in the morning, waking him up and walking to school with him. Other characters might comment that it looks like they are already dating.Are there some common seminal works where they all are coming from in the roots of manga? Do they come from works in some other medium, which had a strong influence on Japanese culture? Were they based on real life acquaintances of a the authors?",

They have a very tall (maybe 4 or 5 stories tall? Definitely taller than our 2 story house) tree in their backyard that was struck by lightning several years ago and no longer grows leaves or anything. It leans slightly to the right, but none of it hangs onto our property. Since we've moved in, after storms we've noticed small branches in our backyard that are consistent with the only dead tree in the area (neighbors tree). They've never caused any damage, and my puppy thinks all these free sticks are pretty awesome. Recently, the sticks in my yard have gotten slightly larger and are now small thick logs. It's a little unnerving to see a small log randomly in your backyard, but I digress. Today we had a pop up thunderstorm with strong winds (maybe 50-60 mph? Idk, I was at work about 30 minutes away). Anyways, my husband came home and the back fence now has a large tree through the middle and a big gap. There are large branches strewn about the backyard, and some of them fell at such a velocity that they ripped up some fairly large sized holes in our backyard. It also killed a baby tree that was planted right before we bought the house. Luckily nothing else was damaged, including our shed that I was CONVINCED it would fall on. [Here's](http://imgur.com/T38jv2e) an image of the damage.After doing some research on property lines it looks like the fence was built about a foot or two into our property. Obviously we will be talking to our homeowners insurance, sure, but will our neighbor be responsible for anything since it was his negligence to a tall, leaning, dead tree that eventually caused the damage? He has told us in the past in passing that the fence is his because he got mad when my puppy ate a hole in one of the boards of his fence. We replaced it since our puppy did the damage. Any and all insight would be great. Thanks! ",

The game is a large open shared universe where you explore the vast galaxy and its planets and civilizations. The goal is to make a name for your self in the galaxy.Everyone starts on earth where you gather up supplies for your ship the supplies range from weapons to extra fuel and medicine to machines to help colonize planets. Once set you embark and head out to one of the thousands planets, each planet will vary in size and eco system. Some of the planets will be your basic cold or jungle or desert ones, while others will be crazy crystal like ones or ones with eternal night.still others will be unexplorable without the right equipments. You will also encounter a vast variety of species ranging from simple germs to advanced star spanning empires. The way you make your mark in the universe is by the following A.) exploring:you can chose to travel the stars cataloging the vast universe and selling the information of where valuable resources are at B.) create colonies  : make settlements across the galaxy that other players will be able to work and engage in. they can start as simple straw hut type stuff and turn into vast Starship ports. C.) resource gathering aka merchant work  and manufacturing: gather the resources of universe and sell it at profit create vast merchant fleets or large factories dedicated to manufacturing what the universe needs.D.) pirating and security: perhaps you just want to pump a few rounds into people than you can use your skills to do just that . You can be hired to escort valuable cargo across the galaxy or even to steal it.What makes this different is all these goals can be done either with people or against them. You can explore planets with your friends or create large companies ,colonize planets,even fight other human created factions. The aliens will also play a big part in the game as the players will have to learn how to deal with them.The game will offer full customization  for person and ship as well as settlement building. You can create and build  simple fast ships or large freight ones to super advanced attack ships. Same with settlements you can be simple as mud huts to large cities that become universally known.  While exploring you must be cautious as death results in you losing your ship and your stats which cannot be gained back unless you have special technical tool like a cloning vat or a return beacon Skills are what allow your character to interact with the world and change it  the skills range from negotiating to flying to scientific knowledge and fighting tactics etc etc etcUltimately the goal would be to have this large universe filled with all these different  player controlled civilizations with their own armies and  ships trading or fighting across the galaxy.

It's been elsewhere noted that one reason we make (good) friends in our youth is a common struggle that can draw us closer: school, a sportsteam, time in the military - in a twisted way this has been offered as a purpose for fraternty hazing.There seems to be less of these common struggles in adulthood and I wonder if that's one reason some of us feel like we have fewer close friends. Work is the obvious exception. Other things like raising kids or making a home tend to be shared bonding with someone who is our partner already. Just wondering if there are other common bonding experiences out there? Might be good ways to focus on making deeper friendships. ",

		"text": "Hi,Bevor ich anfange, müsst ihr wissen dass ich noch Deutsch lerne, also es wird Fehler im Post geben. (Das könnt ihr gerne korrigieren)Runterscrollen für TL;DR.&amp;nbsp;So, erst kurz zu mir. 22 Jahre. Männlich. Ausländer. Bin seit 2,5 Jahren hier. Davor habe ich kein Wort Deutsch gelernt. Alles hier gelernt. Ich rante hier weil ich keine Freunde habe.&amp;nbsp;Seitdem ich hier bin versuche ich in die Uni zu kommen. Kein Erfolg. Erst musste ich Deutsch lernen. Und natürlich ist das in Ordnung. Aber schon nach dem B1-Kurs hat mich unser Jobcenter zur Arbeit geschickt. Die Universitäten verlangen meistens C1 oder höher für die Zulassung. Und jetzt mit der Arbeit kann ich nicht mehr so schnell Kurse machen (Die ersten drei Stufen habe ich in 3 Monaten geschafft, mit den nächsten drei Stufen hat's 21 Monate gedauert). Nach dieser Zeit habe ich einen zweiten Job gefunden, damit ich nicht mehr auf soziale Hilfe angewiesen bin. Aber es ging. Habe den TestDaF gemacht und bestanden. Und jetzt ist es Zeit mich bei Unis zu bewerben.&amp;nbsp;Es war Sommersemester, das heißt dass die Zahl der Unis die mir zur Auswahl standen gering war. Ich wollte schon immer die Universität die ich heute Uni X nenne. Aber bei der kann man nur im Wintersemester starten.&amp;nbsp;Ist OK. Ich habe weiter recherchiert und drei andere Unis gefunden: Uni A, Uni B, Uni C. Am liebsten wollte ich Uni A.Nachdem ich mich beworben habe ist folgendes passiert: Uni C hat mich ohne weiteres zugelassen. Uni B hat mich zu einer Zulassungsprüfung eingeladen. Uni A (die Favorite) hat sich nicht gemeldet. Die Uni A hat nicht mal eine E-Mail zur Bestätigung des Eingangs meiner Unterlagen geschickt.&amp;nbsp;Hier fängt die Scheiße an. Ich bin zur Zulassungsprüfung der Uni B gegangen. 10 Fragen. Alle haben was zu tun mit dem Studiengang auf den ich mich bewerbe. Eine Frage habe ich: **Wie** zum Teufel soll ich diese Scheiße beantworten? Ich bewerbe mich auf diesen Studiengang **damit** ich diese Scheiße lerne. Wenn ich die Antworten kännte bräuchte ich keine Uni. Aber das war eine frühzeitige Reaktion. Denn nach jeder Frage gab es eine kurze Erklärung wie das funktioniert. Also jeder der Mathe kann, kann es mit ein bisschen denken schaffen. Im Nachhinein sehe ich eigentlich dass die Zulassungsprüfung der Uni B ziemlich fair war. In zwei Wochen habe ich eine Rückmeldung von Uni B bekommen: Prüfung mit Note 2.0 bestanden.Uni A hat sich immer noch nicht gemeldet.&amp;nbsp;Jetzt habe ich zwei Zusagen und ein ?. Nach zwei Tagen habe ich das International Office der Uni A angerufen um nach dem Stand meiner Bewerbung zu fragen.Keiner ist dran gekommen.Am nächsten Tag dasselbe.Am dritten Tag ist jemand dran gekommen.\"Der für Sie zuständige Mitarbeiter ist momentan nicht da\"\"OK wann ist er da?\"\"Das weiß ich leider nicht. Rufen Sie nächste Woche an\"Die ersten vier Tage der nächsten Woche kommt keiner ans Telefon.Am Freitag ist ein Mann dran gekommen\"Ja tut mir leid. Der zuständige Mitarbeiter ist grad nicht bei mir\"\"OK wann soll ich anrufen?\"\"rufen Sie am besten nächste Woche am Dienstag an\".Ich rufe dann an und endlich erreiche ich den Mitarbeiter.\"Sie sind nicht zugelassen\"\"Öhhhmm.. Könnten Sie mir die Gründe erzählen?\"\"Das darf ich Ihnen leider nicht mitteilen\".Jep. Einfach so am Telefon. Wenn ich nicht angerufen hätte hätten sie sich wahrscheinlich nicht gemeldet. (Ein bisschen mehr Kontext: Ich habe meine ausländischen Unterlagen bei uni-assist e.V. prüfen lassen. Im deutschen System wäre meine Abi-Note 1.6. Ich weiß nicht genau aber ich glaube das muss für meinen Studiengang reichen. Letztendlich bewerbe ich mich nicht auf Medizin oder so.)&amp;nbsp;OK dann. Uni B ist es. Bin dahin gefahren und habe mich *endlich* eingeschrieben. Und habe angefagen eine Wohnung in der neuen Stadt zu suchen. Nach einiger Zeit habe ich was gefunden und wollte umziehen. Ich bin zum Bürgeramt gegangen um mich umzumelden.\"Err.. Ich glaube das geht nicht\"\"?\"\"Sie müssen mit der Ausländerbehörde reden\" OK.Ich gehe zur Ausländerbehörde\"Jaaaaa. Sie dürfen mit Ihrem Aufenthaltstitel nicht umziehen. Ihr Aufenthalt ist auf Bundesland XYZ beschränkt\"\"Ja aber ich bin in Uni B eingeschrieben und das Semester fängt bald an\"\"..... Ich glaube es gibt einen Umweg aber ich muss erst meinen Vorgesetzten fragen. Kommen Sie nächste Woche wieder\"Ich komme nächste Woche wieder. Sie wollte meinen Studentenausweis und meine Immatrikulationbescheinigung kopieren und an die Ausländerbehörde im anderen Bundesland schicken.\"Ich melde mich bei Ihnen wenn ich eine Antwort habe\"*Vier Wochen später*Niemand meldet sich. Ich gehe nochmal zur Ausländerbehörde.\"Ich habe noch keine Antwort\"\"Das Semester fängt nächste Woche an\"\"Tut mir leid dafür aber ohne Erlaubnis dürfen Sie nicht dahin\".&amp;nbsp;OK OK OK. OK. O-fucking-K. Erstes Semester verpasst. Kein Ding. Jetzt habe ich mehr Zeit zu arbeiten und ein bisschen mehr Geld zu verdienen. Und vor allem kann ich mich diesmal bei Uni X bewerben, der Uni die ich schon immer wollte.&amp;nbsp;*Fast forward drei Monate*Ich bewerbe mich im Onlineportal der Uni X. Total begeistert. Am nächsten Tag sofort alle Unterlagen schicken. Zwei Wochen später bekomme ich eine Einladung zu einem Gespräch. Bin kurz vorm Weinen. Meine Träume verkörpern sich vor meinen Augen. \"Eignungsfeststellungsgespräch\". lol dafür gibt's Gespräche? Aber OK ich habe ja die Zulassungsprüfung der Uni B bestanden. Das dürfte keine große Hürde sein. Ich bin ja total geeignet.&amp;nbsp;*Fast forward eineinhalb Monate*Ich fahre dahin voller Begeisterung. Ich stehe vor der Fakultät mit großer Freude die ich selten habe. Gehe rein und regestriere mich fürs Gespräch. Muss zwei Stunden warten. Ist ja kein Ding die Stadt ist total geil. Komme 15 Minuten früher zurück und warte vor der Tür der Professorin. Sie ruft mich pünktlich um die vereinbarte Uhrzeit auf. Ich grüße sie und gehe mit ihr rein. Da sitzt noch ein Doktorand. Ich grüße ihn auch. Ich bitte um Erlaubnis mich hinzusetzen. Und es fängt an.&amp;nbsp;Sie blättert meine Unterlagen durch als ob sie das zum ersten mal macht. (später bestätigt sich diese Vermütung).Ich erzähle kurz was zu meiner Person und zu meinem Hintergrund. *Ihr Gesicht: Neutral*\"OK. Und warum die Uni X und keine andere?\"\"Ich habe so viele tolle Sachen über Uni X gehört dass ich jetzt überzeugt bin dass die Uni X die beste Wahl ist.\" *Und noch ein bisschen mehr Bewerbungsgesprächkram**Ihr Gesicht: Nicht beeindruckt.*\"OK ich sehe Sie können sehr gut Deutsch wie lange sind Sie schon hier? Jetzt ich weiß nicht wie gut Sie schriftlich sind aber Sie können in Ordnung sprechen\" (1. Wie lange ich schon hier bin steht in meinem Motivationsschreiben. 2. Das Motivationsschreiben habe ich selber verfasst. Wenn sie es gelesen hätte, wüsste sie dass ich auch OK schreiben kann. 3. Ich habe eine Kopie von meinem TestDaF-Zeugnis meinen Unterlagen beigefügt)\"... Ich bin seit zweieinhalb Jahren hier\"*Ihr Gesicht: ein bisschen beeindruckt*\"OK warum dieser Studiengang und kein anderer?\"\"Weil ich diese Sachen mag und habe große Leidenschaft dafür\"\"Wissen Sie was es in unserem Studienplan gibt?\"\"Diese Frage wollte ich Ihnen stellen\"\"*Lacht* Es wird erwartet dass man sich mindestens mit dem Studiengang befasst bevor man sich bewirbt. Dieser Studiengang ist so und so und so...\"\"Ja... das weiß ich alles aber Sie haben mich nach **dem Studienplan der Uni X** gefragt. Da habe ich nicht reingeschaut aber ansonsten weiß ich natürlich worum es in diesem Studiengang geht\"*Ihr Gesicht: Glaubt mir nicht**Ich \"Bewerbe mich eigentlich um einen Job? Solche Fragen bekommt man in Bewerbungsgesprächen für Jobs\"*\"OK haben Sie schonmal ein Projekt gemacht was mit diesem Studiengang zu tun hat?\"\"Leider nein. Ich habe in meiner Heimat nur zwei Jahre studiert und in dieser Zeit habe ich nur theoretisch gelernt. Und in der Schule hatten wir dieses Fach gar nicht.\"*Ihr Gesicht: -_-*\"OK ich sehe dass Ihre Note in Mathe sehr gut ist. Diese Aufgabe müssten Sie lösen können. Ich gebe Ihnen dieselbe Aufgabe die ich dem vorherigen Bewerber gegeben habe\"*Nimmt ein Blattpapier in die Hand und fängt an Knoten und andere Sachen zu zeichnen**Fragt mich irgendetwas zu der Zeichnung**Ich: 0% verstanden*\"Ich.. habe die Frage nicht verstanden. Könnten Sie das anders erklären?\"*Sie: Irgendwas**Ich: immer noch 0%**Sie erklärt was sie wollte und löst die Aufgabe selber**Ich verstehe immer noch nicht**Sie gibt mir was anderes auf**Ich: 5% verstanden aber immer noch nicht genug die Aufgabe zu lösen**Ihr Gesicht: Nicht ganz begeistert**Sie erklärt mir die Aufgabe und löst sie selber**Ich: \"Erm.. Das... ist doch einfach. Das hatte ich vor 5 Jahren im Abi.... Warum konnte ich diese Scheiße nicht?\"*\"OK Können Sie kurz draußen warten?\" \"OK\".&amp;nbsp;Während ich draußen warte versuche ich herauszufinden was schiefgelaufen ist und warum. Ich stelle dann fest das ich zwar den größten Teil der Schuld trage. Aber der Auswahlprozess der Uni X ist auch nicht gerade fehlerfrei.1. Ihr wollt mit **einer** Aufgabe feststellen, ob man für den Studiengang geeignet ist? Wie doof ist das denn? **eine** Aufgabe?2. Es wird erwartet dass man Projekte gemacht hat? Bitch Ich bewerbe mich hier genau um das Wissen zu erwerben mit dem ich diese Projekte machen kann.3. Wie um Gottes Willen wollt ihr dass ich was zu dem Studiengang weiß, wenn ich hier in Deutschland kaum Zeit für mich selber habe? Ich habe **zwei** Jobs. Alles damit ich kein Geld mehr vom Staat nehmen muss. &amp;nbsp;*Sie kommt wieder*\"Ja um.. Sie haben eine sehr geringe Punktzahl erreicht. Es sieht für Sie nicht gut aus. Ich würde also nicht fest drauf bauen. Es gibt ja andere Universitäten.. *blah blah*\"&amp;nbsp;Ich verlasse die Fakultät mit den gebrochenen Teilen meiner Träume und fahre zurück nach Hause.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;TL;DR Ich komme nicht in die Universität, nicht weil das System unfair ist, sondern weil meine Umstände gerade Scheiße und unfair sind.EDIT: Ein paar Typos korrigiert und einige Änderungs der besseren Lesbarkeit halber.EDIT 2: Das Wort \"Frage\" habe ich zu \"Aufgabe\" geändert im vorletzten Abschnitt.EDIT 3: \"Doktrorrand\" zu \"Doktorand\" geändert. Danke an /u/Kazumara für die Korrektur.",

The numeric version is a way for me to keep a copy of everything they do AND to verify if there is any form of plagiarism with a software. On lab 4, I caught two students for plagiarism.

Ideally I would get a girl interested in me by not showing her as much attention as she's seeking, but I also want to expand my social circle so I don't want to completely throw it away. Any idea how to handle it in situations like this? With this particular girl, I'm going to stop snapchatting her for a while since the streak is broken anyway (she broke it).",

I also recently purchased the twin lot immediately to the south so as to have some form of yard and room to build more stuff. The neighborhood isn't all that impressive, neighbors to the south have a doublewide, and neighbors to the north have a house, but it's pretty shitty and probably worth about the same as the doublewide. By the way my home was appraised about $84,xxx when I bought it.There are some things I definitely want to improve about the home/property, but I don't want to just go hog wild as I feel like the surrounding properties will drag down the value of what I've done. I want to build a detached 8x12 wooden storage shed out back(about $1,200). I want to build a nice wood fence around the property, probably 4' high wood fence around the property, with decorative brick columns on the street side(about $3,500-$4,000). I want to update the countertops from cheap wood veneer to granite or quartz(about $2,000), and perhaps a brick patio out back too with firepit and maybe a water feature and lots of brick planters scattered around(cost unknown, probably no more than $1,000).So, my question is, from a resale standpoint, do you think these projects would return anywhere close to their initial investment if I go through with them? I want to make my home really nice like I want, but it is by no means a permanent home, just a starter home, so there will come a day when I do have to sell it, and I just don't want to put too much effort/money into improvements that I will never recoup.",

To me it exemplifies the possibilities of the craft and how an actor can truly become another person. Not only that but it's the only movie I've seen that takes a person that commits one of the worst crimes imaginable to his fellow man and keeps him as just that, a person. Bacon keeps this character completely real and grounded, I never once doubt he's a pedophile but I also never doubt he's a man with thoughts, emotions, and regrets, so many regrets. In addition he plays the part with such an understated beauty that you could genuinely see him as a guy riding the bus with you.

We've definitely been enjoying it, but I've been trying to tweek it to make sure games are fair, both the Archenemy and Allies have a chance, etc. One thing that feels awkward is how to handle infinite combos.My thinking is that the allies shouldn't win with infinite combo because it's a very archenemy thing to do. The only way past this, though, is to have everyone pick specific decks that don't combo out. This restricts decks that can be used, and is something that can occasionally be missed (I accidentally found an infinite combo in one of my decks).Has anyone run into a similar issue? Do people who run infinite combos just not often play archenemy? Do people still play archenemy? With the upcoming Bolas set coming out this will be a more relevant discussion.My main goal is to make games easy to sit down and play, and for people to be able to play what they want instead of avoiding decks that either rely on or happen to have an easy out. Would love to get other opinions on this!",

In the middle of the battle the Minoan fighters felt blessed, perhaps Zeus was looking out for Minoa.

I've tried using a vibration alarm clock (which I now use only on important days because after a while it stops waking me up), a sunrise simulating alarm clock, moving the alarm clock across the room, setting 10 different alarm clocks...Does anyone relate to this or have similar experiences?

It did NOT end on good terms. Literally decades ago though. They no longer live in the same country. FIL gets REALLYYYY upset that Fiance still talks to HIS OWN MOM. For years, he was the only one in the family who didn't know. I guess he happened to come across Fiance's phone while her most recent call was open on the screen and he absolutely lost it. I was really hoping we would be able to invite Fiance's mom to the wedding, but I guess that clears up any of THOSE concerns.He's also just very overbearing. Fiance is 30 and FIL cannot let go. He treats him like a child. He instructs Fiance on the most minor of tasks. Everything from how he's cutting the vegetables to his lifestyle choices (job related). For a LONG time, Fiance didn't pursue his own dreams because he was afraid of what his dad would think. he's finally had the courage to do so and as such regularly faces backlash for it.FIL literally doesn't believe any legitimate information that is coming from Fiance, but regularly follows medical advice he receives from forwarded text messages in his group chats as if its come from God himself. If Fiance disagrees with any idea put forth by FIL, it no longer becomes an idea, but a demand. If he gets angry about this, he begins to berate Fiance about how he's never been sucessful and won't be because he's too stubborn to admit when he's wrong, and is never willing to listen from others (this was also said to Fiance when FIL found out Fiance and his mom were still talking). He throws in so many things that are irrelevant to whatever they're actually arguing about such as how if Fiance doesn't figure out how to compromise then his marriage will never be successful either.  Just horrid things that just don't need to be brought up.Fiance does a lot for FIL and aside from acknowledging it, he complains about the quality of work done. For everything. But especially if Fiance cooks for him. He literally will not eat certain foods because they look like other foods that he does not like and complains that Fiance continues to cook these things. Overall, it just feels like he never really got over the divorce and he's taking it out on Fiance. I have a feeling that this is going to cause a problem in our marriage. I feel like FIL's tendency to try and control won't go away. Apparently, FIL's father had similar control issues and it partly the reason why FIL and fiances mom divorced.Also, FIL has no real concept of money. He doesn't make a lot by any means, but he has almost no idea how to save money and as a result ends up asking Fiance for money a lot of times. We're trying to save for our wedding/future. We both also have student loans to take care of. I simply don't think its fair of him to do, but we also don't want him to be short on rent. He is not so horrible that we'd want to see him on the streets!Fiance DOES see the problems with his dad and we will soon be moving away, but we kind of have to wait a while due to school/work reasons. I have had a conversation with Fiance where we both understand that under no circumstances will we be making any marital decision simply to please a member of our family, and that our marriage will be about NOBODY but us. We're both on the same page, but I still worry.Any advice on how to move forward? Our wedding is soon. I don't know. I feel like there isn't a point to this post. I just wanted to rant I guess. I know its kind of vague and rambly. I intentionally left out details to leave out identifying factors. If something specific happens, I'll be sure to post again.",

		"text": "So I've been a Verizon subscriber since 2009. I recently experienced a problem with my older Droid Turbo II, so I began looking at a new phone. At the time (~45 days ago), they were running a promotion of $7/mo off of a new Moto Z2 Play(for a total of $168 savings). Promotion stated that a new line was required and agreement to pay $408 for the device, to which a credit of $7 would be applied each month. Out of curiosity I opened a chat with a representative to inquire if I would have to maintain two separate lines or if I could activate a new line, then deactivate the first line. I was told this would be ok and I would still qualify. Needless to say I was a bit skeptical. So I opened a chat with a different representative the next day to confirm. Once again, this was confirmed that I would still qualify for the promotion. So at this point my mind is at ease and I pull the trigger.Fast forward to today, I'm looking at my bill which happens to be about ~$10 more than expected. I pull up a chat with the representative and guess what? Now they tell me that because I disconnected the original line, that now I'm suddenly not eligible for the promotion. Needless to say I'm a bit pissed. So I think I'll be switching to AT&amp;T. I could fight this with Verizon if I still had a screenshot of the chat sessions where they told me I could do it, but conveniently the record of the chat never made it to my email.So... I've since had my old phone replaced under warranty, and I own it outright. So can anyone tell me if I'm gonna be held liable for the remainder of payments for this new phone? Or will Verizon accept it back? Are there any options I'm not aware of perhaps?I've always been cool with Verizon, but this bullshit really got under my skin. I wouldn't have purchased this phone if I hadn't been told I was eligible for the promotion.",

I would like considered thoughts about what the middle east and the worldwide Jewish community would look like in a world where Israel was never founded, and whether that would be better or worse (and for whom) than what we have now.  Brief background, condensed from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html).&gt; Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of Palestine, and the UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Nonetheless, an Israeli state was declared in 1948 and the Israelis subsequently defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the deep tensions between the two sides. Israel and Palestinian officials signed in 1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the \"Oslo Accords\"), enshrining the idea of a two-state solution to their conflict and guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. However, this solution has repeatedly been undermined by undermined by conflict between Israel and Palestinian groups, and the years since then have been characterized by alternations between diplomacy and violence.

But something that has seemed pretty out of place for me is the updating of Nunu's splash art. Not the actual splash art image I think it looks great. Willump finally has some brawn to him and isn't a little disney-like character in portrayal anymore. I'm sure there are others that share my opinion on the actual portrait or ingame icon of nunu himself as the darker colors seem to make Nunu's headshot feel out of place in the league art.That aside, my scepticism arises from the fact that Nunu's splash was relatively fine in comparison to Anivia's. When going through the [Freljord](http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/index.html) site that riot set up as part of a tutorial into the lore of of the iceborn and related champions, I had to take an extra second when I came to Anivia's portrait. While many of us have come to love the traditional look of our favorite champion I feel like Anivia's silhouette is rather edgy or \"unfinished\". I love all the creative decisions that are made day in and day out for one of the most popular games in the world. With all of what the patch was built up to be, it succeeds and more (i.e. Nunu's new splash). I just feel Anivia's default splash might have been more deserving of an update especially when compared against her new skin and recent vu's such as ashe (recent is a stretch but relatively) and tryndamere.tl;dr Why update the Nunu splash over Anivia?",

Granted I've learned a lot by doing so, but it always becomes a problem if I don't snap myself out of the trance. Due to this, I've done away with pornography after realizing that it only fuels my net addiction.Intermediate Mode I'd describe as the following: No porn, no masturbating. Edging only applies if you **have an actual method behind engaging in this action and if you have the resolve to time yourself.** I'll explain this in further detail at a later time but will stress that I do not recommend it for those with a serious, unshakable compulsion for self-pleasure via masturbation to engage in it.I've noticed two primary types of people within NoFap: those who are doing it as more of a self-control challenge, and those who are doing it because it's proven to be far too great of a negative influence in their life. I situate myself in the former but empathize with those in the latter.**That being stated...**I want to construct a resource guide for all of you, given away for free.It will be divided into two sections: The former dealing with the NoFap phenomenon and the latter dealing with sexual mastery for when you find a partner and want to reap the same benefits (or \"superpowers\" as they're often referred to here) while involving yourself with this challenge. This will serve as my way of saying thank you to the community before I leave for good.Hopefully it will be done before the end of the year.

My question is, does it bother you that your SO has less experience?  Or does it not bother you at all? Like is this even a thing? I mean..I just feel like if I was in his position, I would expect certain things from my SO and if they don't meet it, I could see why I would be upset.I guess the root of it all is that I'm totally insecure about my lack of experience. How can I get over that? Any advice would be great and much appreciated.",

Her best friend came to me and told me that the entire time post-breakup she hated me and that it was pretty much over, and my ex would regret hooking up with that dude.Obviously, he's just a rebound, but I'm worried that they will be under my nose for a while. I did manage to sleep with some women after we broke upWhat should I do?I remember the good times we had. I remember a concert we went to, and introducing her to my friends, fraternity brothers and my female best friend. She liked a kitten and she wanted to adopt one and we were looking forward to living in an apartment together with one. TL;DR: how do I get over seeing my ex with another guy? ",

The answer is always yes, somebody else agrees with you in the world.Secondly, I will apologize because I have not seen this movie in a while and maybe I am just remembering it fondly. But anyway, I think it has all the makings of a good horror movie. At the time I feel like the space thing hadn't been done to death quite yet, so the atmosphere was fairly claustrophobic and self-contained. The body count was pretty damn high for a 90 minute movie with Jason taking out a dozen co-eds and two groups of soldiers. And most of the kills were pretty creative. The ice head smash, the sleeping bag bash, the chick getting sucked into space, the other chick killing herself, and more. There was even a semi-believable backstory about the government wanting to find out and harness why Jason was so unstoppable that if fleshed out would have given the movie a pretty solid plot in the past and future times. And that's really all I look for from a slasher: pretty people dying in unique ways.Now for what it had going against it, I honestly don't think it was that bad. The two glaring errors I see are the tone and the scientific accuracy. There were just too many puns, and if anybody deserves the over-serious treatment that so many horror films get today, it's Jason. Second, the science could have been tightened up a little bit, even for a sci-fi movie. The glaring example being when Uber Jason gets blown away from half the ship, he somehow just manages to change his trajectory to get back on, and it's pretty common knowledge that can't be done.The rest of it I feel was pretty solid. The effects were good, the jumps were there. I think this movie gets some unnecessary hate.",

With the Peace Corps spreading Technocratic teaching and the army bring land in. This book will be key to enlightening the world. Scribes will be hire to copy down the book to be given to foreigners. This Technocrat's Manifesto will be a gift to all peoples and hopefully the masses flock to the light and join and embrace Technocracy.---* We wrote a book about Kansan Technocracy * Gonna give it to the unenlightened---[5/2/15] ",

If you want something done, ask a woman.\" With equal parts naivety and intellectual sincerity, I asked my FBFs if they'd still be comfortable with this quote if the gender generalization was reversed. Needless to say, the question sparked a passionate reaction from my friends of both genders. The discussion boiled down to the title question, but none of the responses were satisfactory (people kinda dodged it). So...cloaked in our blanket of anonymity, dear blunt Redditors, I'd love to hear YOUR thoughts on this hypothesis. Disclaimer: I'm a fairly standard-issue adult white man, except I was raised by my single mom who is an outspoken feminist. I've happily worked my entire career at a company founded by women, and the staff ratio of women to men is about 4:1. I'm probably as attuned to sexism (whichever direction it happens to run) as most any white guy can be. ",

In that time frame I also managed to fully reboot and have successful sex.Now prior to that streak, I had been 'trying' NoFap for 2 years but had never made it further than a few weeks before relapse. So what made this 5 month streak different?It was because I had a lifestyle which reinforced the discipline aspect of NoFap. During that streak I was also going gym 3 times a week doing the Stronglifts 5x5 program, I was doing uphill sprints 2x a week and I was also carefully watching my diet/macros, in addition to meditating 45 minutes most days. Also had cold showers every day.Had I relapsed during that streak, all of that would have went down the drain. My entire foundation would break had I relapsed to PMO - much akin to a domino effect, the gym, meditation, diet etc would all follow. Now I have relapsed since that streak and had several binges unfortunately, and I just had the eureka moment today it was my lifetsyle that caused me to relapse. I don't go gym anymore, I often skip lectures and wake up late, and that feeds into PMO. If I have the mentality of ''Oh, I'm not going to this lecture I can't be bothered'' and ''Cba with a cold shower today I'll have a warm bath instead'' then it's no surprise that my mind will think ''Come on, just have one more wank for old times sake''. **Relapsing when you have a shitty lifestyle doesn't feel as bad because the rest of your life isn't going anywhere anyway**.I need to get the warrior-like lifestyle back, because that brings about a sense of urgency: relapsing would make you feel 10x worse because you'd ruin every other aspect of the self improvement.",

While getting rid of clutter is a great move, I've always found that behaviors, responsibilities and circumstances determine the complexity of my life to a far greater degree than the amount of possessions I  have. As an example, if I had a demanding career, a kid, a dog, a long commute and a house, my life would be significantly more complex and stressful than it is now, no matter how well organized everything was and how little I owned.Of course, getting rid of worn out socks and old papers is an easy first step to take, and it can eventually lead to someone switching careers or moving into a smaller apartment. But big choices like choosing not to have kids or breaking ties with a toxic family are rarely discussed from a simple life point of view. What's the biggest thing not related to stuff that makes your life simpler, or a change you hope to make in the future?",

They asked for an in-person interview the next day so I did that and it went well. They said they were looking to make a decision by that day or the next day and would plan on getting back to me immediately. When almost a week passed and I heard nothing, I called them. I then received an e-mail that essentially said \"Dear Applicant.... based on your skills and experience we've chosen someone better suited to the job.\"  Okay, but felt kind of weird since they knew my skills and experience before even interviewing me, just by looking at my resume.The next day, I received an e-mail from one of the other locations of that same school. They wanted a phone interview so I called them that day and the interview went well. They said they were looking to fill the position soon and would e-mail me next week after they interviewed other candidates and made a decision. Just two hours later, I received that same generic e-mail from before that said \"Dear Applicant, we've had time to review your resume and compare it against other candidates and based on your skills and experience, we chose someone else.\" I'm so confused and so hurt. Two hours was enough time for them to decide? I don't know why they even contacted me if apparently my skills/experience wasn't good enough. Part of me wants to call them and ask why they did that and part of me doesn't want to work with such flaky people.

Although when we were together, we used to meet for an hour or so during those 4 years. We live 1000 miles apart now. We had sex only after coming to US as we were living a more conservative country and spending time together in a closed room wasn't possible. I discovered that I have a very high sex drive. Although I meet my SO in every 1-2 months, I crave for more rest of the time. Also, I feel like LDR is not for me. I feel attracted to other guys. I have never acted on my crushes or attractions unless I am very very drunk (which happened only twice and I hugged and kissed once, other time it was just a peck on the cheek).  I have now stopped drinking completely. I told him about both the incidents and he is \"okay\" with it, he just wants to be with me.

Which is normal for the first few days. Next day the new symbol AXXA was up and trading, but it turns out ALL the shares are being borrowed because the originals haven't been released. So basically the thing is going absolutely bananas cus there are no shares. Might be worth buying in and holding until the old TLNUF shares are released, and then I expect it to correct but until then its gonna go bonkers. Like... it was a penny yesterday and today it's pushing 6 cents! I'm talking OWCP type event here, is it gonna crash eventually? For sure but until then skys the limit.

She was worried bad things would happen to us if we went through the Deep South (which my dad really wanted to see).  Also, back in the 1970s my dad's sister-in-law told my mom \"never come to Montana\" (where her side was from) because she would be mistaken for an Indian, and so she refused to ever go to that neck of the woods.If you're a non-white kid from a major coastal metro area, you grow up hearing crazy stories from time to time.  Black people in particular would trade stories about bad shit that would happen if you took the wrong highway exit in the wrong part of the country.  To be sure, I would reckon that half of these stories had changed some in the telling, and that most of them happened decades ago.  We're not the same America that we were in 1962, or so I'd like to believe!So with all that said, and it being the year 2017, if you and your family aren't completely white and you would like to honor that great American family tradition of the cross-country road trip, are there any particular concerns you ought to have?  And hell, what if your name is Mohammed and your boyfriend is named Jose?I mean, might you run into some shit that a white family wouldn't have to anticipate?  Or is all the bad shit of yesteryear all water under the national bridge, as far as exploring our great nation's highways and byways is concerned?Edited to add:  my dad did eventually take us when I was in high school, but other than visiting relatives in the Midwest we never strayed too far off the Interstates.  When we were stopping in West Virginia, my dad (the consummate prankster) snuck up behind my mom and said in his Deliverance voice \"y'aint from around here, are ya?\"  She jumped three feet in the air with a yelp.  Also, my mom and I stopped into a supermarket in rural PA and saw rebel flags absolutely everywhere, more than I'd ever seen in my life.  We were like \"yeah, let's get what we need and GTFO.\"  Nobody hassled us or looked at us funny that I recall, though.This would've been about 1996 or so.",

There's no question about that, it just a matter of taking them to small claims court by this point.This person agreed to pay me the money via Paypal about a month ago. I waited and received absolute silence from the individual - no payment, no texts, no updates. I texted to check up on the payment. No response.I then did very bluntly list all the laws the individual was breaking, the agencies I would be reporting them to, the consequences for their provably illegal actions - this includes but is not limited to: making a profit from renting out a rent stabilized apartment, hiding assets during a divorce, using her apartment as a short stay on Airbnb (less than 30 days while she's out of the country), agreeing to pay full refund of the rent I paid her and hen refusing after I had vacated unit, explaining to me that she would be lying in court during the divorce hearings between herself and her husband. Etc. Etc.I sent maybe 10 texts throughout 1 day, the day that I realized that I had been, without question, scammed by this individual. HOWEVER, a couple of these texts were accidental copies (I was copying some texts to send to my mom/have a record of, and somehow re-sent them to her).I did not intend to threaten the individual. I did not intend to intimidate. I did very clearly list out the legal actions I would be taking and the repercussions for her (provably) deceitful, unlawful behavior.She then responded (I'm paraphrasing): \"Stop this harassment. You'll be offered a cash refund in May. For now, you live your life and stop trying to belittle mine.\"I did stop contacting her at the point, beyond 3 messages (throughout about 3 weeks, 1 message per week). These messages did not request the money. I made it very clear that they were messages of courtesy, notifying her of the reports/complaints that I made against her (IRS, NYC Department of Housing, Paypal) so that she may respond to the necessary complaints. In each message, I asked that should she have retained counsel, I be notified so that communication may be directed to the retained attorney. She responded to none of these messages.I've also sent three Paypal requests for the money owed - two which were \"canceled\" by her, one which is not being responded to.So, does she have a case against me for harassment? I did not intend to annoy/harass. I only listed out facts, while she, on the other hand, did personally attack me in writing, accusing me of making up the accusations among other silly, petty insults I think were meant to \"hurt my feelings\".I obviously just wanted to get the money legally owed to me and all discussion (on my part) does directly relate to the owed money. No personal attacks were made, nor were false accusations made, by myself. All of this was in private text; I shared a couple texts with my mom.Any advice/insight is appreciated. Thank you.EDIT TO ADD: I just want to add, also, that AFTER this person told me to \"stop this harassment,\" they continued to actively engage in conversation and personally attack me. I did not respond with personal attacks. Instead, I let them know that I could not meet for a cash refund in May (I'll genuinely be out of town), and needed the money now via Paypal as previously agreed upon. They then blocked me.",

They went through a quick background because I was there last week for my exam. They also did another pregnancy test. The same obgyn who examined me performed procedure and it was way easier than I thought it would be. She cleaned and disinfected the injection site, and used lidocaine to numb the area. It slid in seamlessly and I didn't feel it all. Afterwards she put a special bandage on, went over aftercare and gave me a card with information, in case of recall. I'm supposed to call and register which is cool!I'm pretty relieved and satisfied.

I need it to pop right now, and I'm scared.Note: My gear level is MP1 tops, but I'm not going in there anytime soon. Any gearing tips are appreciated, but I'm working on it. My spec is adjustable, but I really like it where it is and will have a hard time parting with some of those passives.What I'm looking for: Tactics mostly, ways to get enough Fury to hit that cost for WotB. What playing tips do you have for this? What skills? Any tricks to generating Fury for a build that has no primary attacks? The problems I'm having are:- HotA sucks up all my Fury, even with Into the Fray and 33%+ Crit (I'm working on more, need a new axe). With large, dense groups, I can probably hit 50 Fury, but I might need WotB for small groups or solo elites as well.- Crits from Sprint don't seem to generate Fury that quickly, unless I'm doing it wrong?- I'm considering War Cry's \"Charge!\" for the extra Fury, but I really don't want to stoop to that.- I really don't want to drop Tough as Nails or Superstition for Unforgiving or Animosity (if I did, which would be better for a HotA Barb?)- Dropping HotA for Bash is my last ditch if I keep being starved during a dangerous fight, but I really love my Hammer.

		"text": "So 4 years into my relationship with my boyfriend who I planned on marrying etc. he starts to act pretty weird regarding his phone - he took it to the bathroom with him, he got upset when I was watching him scroll through his Twitter feed. He started even to go hang out in the bedroom and play an old Fifa on our PlayStation 3 (I keep my old version as it’s backward compatible and I like old RPG games) but spent most of the time glued to his phone (it was a one bed apartment so I could see into the room from the living room). He even got annoyed with me when I went to join him and watch him play. This went on for a month and I finally brought up that he hasn’t said I love you in the whole month, was acting weird with his phone and that sex was pretty much nonexistent. He said nothing was wrong - he wasn’t aware that he hadn’t said I love you, or that he was so protective of his phone and that he’d spend less time on it and say I love you again. He did stick to this - for about a week and then it went straight back to how it had been before. So in the morning when he went to have his shower and his phone was recharging on the night stand I looked at his phone (just his screen, I didn’t have his password so couldn’t actually unlock it) - he had a message from a girl saying ‘I love you’. I got so annoyed and when he came back into the room I asked who was messaging I love you to him, who wasn’t his mother/sister. He said it was his ‘cousin’ from Australia and she was traveling around Europe at the moment. Started with some excuse that saying I love you is common for cousins to say etc. The worst part was that at this stage he really gaslighted me, saying my family just wasn’t very demonstrating with affection and just didn’t use I love you’s like his, that I didn’t trust him, and that he didn’t think he could be with someone who didn’t trust him and if I asked for him to unlock his phone and show me the texts then it would be over as it showed I had no trust at all. I fell for this - I actually did. I started questioning myself and developed a plan to help me increase my trust in him. It was only when accidentally this time (I was taking his phone of the charge in the morning and placing mine on) when I saw a message ‘I love you so much’. I didn’t say anything - and over the next few days I watched him with his phone, I watched him put in his password and I made sure I remembered it. It’s night, he’s sleeping, it’s a few days after I got his password and built myself up enough to break into someone else’s phone. It was as I had feared - he’d been messaging and sexting this other person. I was so upset and so angry- it wasn’t just the cheating at this stage, but his saying I didn’t trust him when I was so very right. That he made me doubt myself and my feelings. I woke him up, told him what i had done and found and then told him we are over. He apologised so much other the next few days, deleted her number and said he’d do anything to make up for this. I believed it, thought we’d had so many great years together and that it was never physical. Three weeks later in a fit of paranoia- I looked in his phone just to make sure he wasn’t texting her - that was clear. But I noticed an app called kik. I went into it but it prompted a password. I googled what this app was, found out it was a messaging app and new for sure I need to find how to access it.I managed to - it was actually a lot of work (I won’t bore you all with those details). Turns out he’s still messaging her, I’m so annoyed and angry and in my anger I message her. Well she had no idea he had a long term girlfriend, she was heart broken and she was super nice. We have actually keep in touch and still email each other. I blow up at him again - he says he’s sorry, that he loves me soooo much etc. And I forgive again.Few weeks later go by - I still can’t fully shake a nagging feeling. So I go into his phone while he’s sleeping again. I find a girls name I’m not familiar with and I start reading - it looks like he is at it again, only worse as these messages go on for years. He wakes up, comes out and finds me, freaks out and deletes those messages straight away and says he’ll block the number etc. Well to bad for him, before he came in I screenshot that number - and I got in contact with her. She didn’t know he had a girlfriend either, she was super nice as well - and even better she had all their messages and sent them to me.Now on this women - my heart goes out to her. She’d been messaging and going on ad hoc dates with my boyfriend before I meet him, he asked her out on dates when I had to go away for business. She never slept with him and he didn’t get more than a few kisses. She was in a bad place mentally - had been scarred by a previous relationship and my boyfriend made her doubt herself. He apparently with her never talked about himself, told her he didn’t have a Facebook page etc. all the while she is thinking this guy is so nice and kind, and I’m being a bitch by not being his girlfriend, I’m as fucked up mentally as I fear. He tried to cover this as his just trying to be a friend to her and helping as she wasn’t well. I didn’t for an instant believe this - he fucked with her mind and made her question herself when she was already in a bad place. This guy was just something else. I lived with him - I would take a month are more to move out. So I bided my time and pretended I forgive him while getting my stuff in order. One night while playing the sims and he’s out I have full access to his emails and I wonder what else this guy is hiding.Not good - he bought used underwear from women (yuck), had a purely sexting relationship (I emailed her and let her know about him). And then I found a email from a cam girl site. I entered the site and I saw were all his money had been going to. He was straight up addicted to this stuff. Now financially I made more than him. It was his apartment that I moved into a year in and I started to pay half is rent (only fair) then about half way into the full relationship he says he has to cut up his credit card and had to take a loan from his father. At the time i was puzzled- he had more disposable income since I entered his life (I usually paid for dinners and most of holidays etc). He actually said that I wasn’t pulling my weight financially and that I should pay him more rent - that just wasn’t going to happen.So I finally left him, but I kept in contact - people thought i was crazy but I did it mostly so if he got a new girlfriend that I might be able to give her a heads up. He did get a new one but he talked about her but never mentioned her name. Due to this I’ve just cut him out altogether.This has impacted me negativity in my new relationship- I really see my current boyfriend as the love of my life and he makes me so happy. Any calls he has he freely has them in front of me and he never hides is phone. However I did tell him if he started acting oddly regarding his phone I would probably snoop, which he wasn’t too happy with but once I explained what happened he understood why I would. I’ve read other people’s stories here and the red flags are many. This ex (the cheater) had really low self esteem and so apparently all this female attention made him feel better about himself (even if he had to pay for it). So thanks for reading - sorry it’s so long. ",

I'm going to make a portfolio so that I stand out.I have a unit plan on outer space for 4th-ish graders and a unit plan on studying the continents for 3rd-ish graders but I don't know if a unit plan is too much.I also have a lesson plan for 1st-ish graders where they swab different areas of the classroom using a cotton swab, but them into a Petri dish and watch the germs grow, which teaches them why we need to wash our hands and keep our classroom clean.Lastly, I have a game that I made up for 4th-ish graders called Fishing for Fractions. It's like Go Fish but with those little plastic fraction pieces. If you don't know what I mean, they come in different colors. There's a full circle. Then there's a circle in two pieces. A circle in 3 pieces. All the way down to 9 pieces. So the point of the game is to complete as many circles as possible. Let's say at this point in the game you have half a circle. You could ask your opponent for a 1/4 piece. If they don't have that, you could ask for a 1/8 piece. The point is to get kids thinking about how fractions relate to each other and what fractions fit inside what other fractions (i.e. two 1/8= 1/4). Let me know if you have any questions. I'm also thinking of putting in a classroom layout, teaching philosophy... anything else that should be in there? Thank you!",

Last year, I got my BS in physics, and in January, I started working at a company as a data analyst using statistics.  I like this company, and they offer tuition reimbursement for employees starting after three months of work.  I was exploring the option of getting a masters in statistics, as I would get it for almost completely free, and it would really advance my career in this company, as well as open new doors outside of the company.  To be frank, I really did not expect to get such a good job with just my bachelors, and since my senior year of college, I had been planning on trying to go to grad school.  However, I was interested more in the field of geology/environmental science, and so I did my undergraduate research in geophysics.  My undergraduate research did involve a lot of statistical methods, and I did use statistics often in my physics classes.  The truth is that I'm not “passionate” per se about either of these fields (if I really was I'd be trying to get a PhD), but there are a few considerations for me now that make me want to do it.  First, my company will pay for it, and so I can get my masters at very little cost to me, no debt involved.  The more important thing, is however, that right now I don't have kids, and a mortgage, and I feel like now is the perfect time to do it, versus if I waited a few years to start. As I've already said, this would really advance my career in this company and in this field, and a lot more than if I just stayed with my bachelor's and tried to get promotions.  Here's where I'm asking for advice: first, has anyone here worked full time and went to grad school part time, and if so, what was your experience like, and what advice would you have? Second, do you think that changing fields and interests so rapidly would negatively affect my chances of getting in?  And lastly, do you think that it's too soon to start looking to start taking advantage of tuition reimbursement at my company, being I've only been there two months?  I was looking to enroll either Fall 2017 of Spring 2018, so by the time I started, I'd have been there a bit longer (so the funding won't be an issue). ",

The problem is that I've been essentially freelancing, and I've been working on shows that range from a few hours a week for a small stipend to shows that are essentially full time, and I'm struggling to figure out how to navigate getting a day job knowing my schedule--and the number of hours I need to work or even can work--varies dramatically, sometimes even week to week. I was working for a tutoring company, but it ultimately didn't work out because both tutoring and theatre tend to happen in the evening. For those of you who work (or have worked) a non-theatre job in addition to your theatre work, how do you manage it?",

The restaurant had a really fancy complementary breakfast, so I went really early in the morning, like 7am. The restaurant was huge, but I was the only one there, except for a couple of sleepy older folk. The restaurant was being manned by the girl who'd checked me in the previous day, and a man who looked to be in his mid-twenties, portly, bespectacled, heavily neckbearded. Since the room was so big and so empty and so quiet, you could hear a pin drop at any point in the restaurant. The two began talking to one another at a normal indoor level of volume, which meant that everyone present could hear everything.He must have been new to the staff because she asked him casually how he was liking working there so far. Immediately he launched into a completely audible life story-type spiel about how he liked it, but that he was only working there for now while he was going to school because he \"didn't want to sit at home and do nothing,\" even though, he proceeded to say, he *could* do that if he wanted. Since he still lived with his parents and he was going to school again because he failed out the first time, he held this job only for side money right now, but he hoped that when a member of upper management passed away, \"because [they] will eventually pass away,\" that he could be promoted to management. The girl said nothing throughout his entire spiel. They both disappeared after that but I wonder if she later told management that their beardy new employee is just waiting for one of them to drop dead so he can get a promotion.edit: a word",

So when I happened upon a listing yesterday that was perfect for us, we jumped on it.  We changed our family plans, I got a babysitter for the newborn, he left work, we had to drive separately to get there to meet the realtor in time, etc.    Husband is working a lot of overtime right now and free time and sleep are not something we have a lot of right now.  It took our whole afternoon and cost us a small amount of money to accomplish.The house was nothing like it was listed.  First of all, it had ONE bathroom.  It has two listed.  It had four bedrooms, it had five listed.  We are a family of six.  We would have never even thought twice about a house with only one bathroom.  It was listed at 2,000 square feet.  Much smaller than what we are currently in, but workable for the right layout and house.  It was MUCH smaller than that.We found out they got away with it by counting a separate mother in law house in the back as part of the main house.  We were looking at this house particularly for that separate housing for my father in law, and the listing had that bathroom, kitchen and dwelling entirely separately.  It was a total waste, and completely dishonest.  The realtor just kind of shrugged.  She had never seen the property before.  I am completely frustrated and want to save another family the same hassle.  How do I report the listing?  ",

I know i have to first gain admission into IU then apply for a school but would having 60 credits make me at a disadvantage. I will be trying for the Kelley School of Business if that helps.

In my opinion MGTOW and MRA are similar to two groups in the past. NAACP and the Black Panthers. Both groups, pointed out injustice and how  a group was getting the raw end of the deal. Both of them demanded a voice, both of them were fighting to end oppression. The difference is in strategy, MRA/NAACP use legal means, and peaceful ways to fight oppression, believing that their can be peace between the two groups. MGTOW/Black Panthers, believe that peace between the two is impossible, or that it's better to create segregated communities. There is a sense of supremacy in the air. Now, What do I mean when I say, they make good points. That's mostly cause they have similar goals to MRAs. The ending of the corrupt family courts, respect to male victims, such as rape victims. Equal Prison sentences between sexes, and that feminism has went to far. I even can somewhat agree with the idea of an Alpha Male and a Beta Male. Or the idea that marriage isn't really worth the money (mostly the wedding). I could (If I were to be super cynical), that women prefer Alphas to Betas.But, I do reject ideas like ending suffrage. Manipulating Women, or trying to justify rape.  I reject other concepts as well. So CMV, That MGTOW is simply misguided radicals that have good goals, but adds a lot of baggage. ",

		"text": "Ah, Final Fantasy II, the ever controversial FF title. Everyone has heard the complaints. Most of them involve the battle system but often they are about the characters, the world, the music... it's just a bad game by FF standards.Or at least that's what most people believe.I've played the original version about 10 years ago, the GBA version about 5 years ago and, to not break the habit of trying out every version of every FF game at least once, I finally played the 20th Anniversary version.Boy, did it blow my mind.Let's look at the game more in-depth, and see why it is actually pretty impressive.**Background:** Final Fantasy II came out exactly 30 years ago on 1988, following the commercial success of Final Fantasy. It was Hironobu Sakaguchi's first project as a director, and he decided to build more on the story and fit the gameplay to the story instead of vice versa. According to him, FFII is the reason the FF series is as huge as it is today. Let's see why.**Story:** The basic concept is pretty simple: three war orphans take up arms and join the resistance against an evil empire. Although simplistic in concept you can tell that Sakaguchi wanted to focus on the story, because under the surface it's so much more than that. As the epilogue points out it's a cautionary tale about war with death, sacrifice, tyranny, dreams, hope, ambition and power being major themes. And boy, let me tell you right now that the story is DARK. In fact, it's the darkest mainline title I've played. You are introduced to the game by watching the Emperor's demon army annihilate an entire village, leaving your 4 main protagonists orphans. Just 2-3 hours into the game the Dreadnaught (Emperor's airship version of an Atomic Bomb) destroys 3 towns full of people. Various NPCs grieve, telling you how their husbands, friends, daughters and sons are dead. Most of your temporary party members are killed. As if that is not enough, the Emperor single-handedly EXTERMINATES most of the world, rendering the towns on the map inaccessible. This always sends chills down my spine, walking over a previously inhabitable town but suddenly finding out I am unable to get inside simply because there's nothing left. There are also hints that the fourth main character was brainwashed into becoming an enemy soldier.Oh, also Firion, the main character, is almost raped by a Lamia impersonating the Queen before he's saved by his friends, which I think is the closest depiction to sex we've seen in the FF universe as a whole, so there's that too.All in all, the story is way too advanced for the time (again, this is late '80s!) and it deals with some very heavy shit.**Characters:** The main characters are Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon. Firion is the standard FF protagonist and adoptive brother/best friend to Guy and Maria. Maria is Leon's sister and is probably the only one with a definitive personality. She holds a grudge against the empire for her brother and spends the game looking for him, but at the same time she's the most compassionate and smartest of the group (the only person to think that perhaps joining a foreign pirate ship may not be a very good idea). She also has a mental breakdown after all your party members start dying and in turn becomes more resolved to finally stop this. As for Guy, he's... there, I suppose. He's the classic trope of a big brutish guy with a heart of gold. He grew up in the wilderness and he speaks beaver. Think adult Gau.Leon/Leonheart is actually my biggest compaint of the game as a whole. He is TERRIBLE. While he deserves props for being the first dark knight of the series and for his really, really cool design, his motivations make no sense. Why did he join the empire? There are \"some\" hints of brainwashing there, but certainly not enough to make a case. Why did he become the emperor after Mateus was killed? Why did he immediately join our cause 5 seconds after Mateus resurfaced when moments ago he wanted to kill the party (sister included) and keep up his predecessor's genocides? Nothing about him makes any sense. In fact he only starts making sense at the end of the game when he wants to go away to atone for his sins. Also, interestingly enough, there's an Easter Egg on a FFIV guide: according to it, Cecil's sword Deathbringer originally belonged to a dark knight 100 years ago named Leonheart, who then renounced the dark arts to become a holy priest. I sure would love to see all that development.The side characters are where the game truly shines though, as most of them intentionally have more substance than the main party. Minwu, Ricard (Kain's dad?) and Josef, who sacrificed their life for the rebels' cause. The Queen herself who had a rather progressive role for the '80s (even if she did end up abducted for a third of the game). Paul, the original Locke. The first Cid! Gordon, who develops from a cowardly prince to a strong leader. Leila, who turns from a pirate scum to an honorable fully fledged freedom fighter (she is just so likable! I was so sad when I thought she died! I wish she had a larger role than she did!). The characters in this game are all excellent, which brings us to...**The villain:** As my flair suggests, I love him. He alone makes the game so it comes to no surprise that he is this entry's logo. He manipulates the resistance to do his own bidding. He is such a narcissist and has such a huge ego that next to his ambition he sees other humans as mere flies, and treats them as such too. He is EXTREMELY despicable but also extremely powerful; he didn't need no Warring Triad or Jenova cells to call upon Whirlwinds that almost destroyed all of his world, he probably did it with a flick of his wrist. Despite loving his design and his presence, I ACTIVELY WANTED HIM DEAD for killing all these people. Then he died and I remembered that this is what he wanted all along, because that's the only way he could TRULY rule everything. I hate to love him and I love to hate him, and thank God for Dissidia not ruining him but actually doubling down on his magnificence.One of my favorite moments has to be when Leon sits on his throne for like 5 minutes, and he arises from Hell to tell him that he ain't shit before destroying the Palamecia palace to give rise to his new one. And of course the speech of his light half, which was introduced in Dawn of Souls, is all kinds of amazing.Not to mention that the guy's ambition and ego were so huge that not even death could stop him. He used death itself (like he used everyone in the game before) as a tool and he killed the divine rulers of heaven and hell respectively to take their place and be the ruler of all. If this is not motivational, I don't know what is.He is severely underrated. For me he's as iconic as Kefka, Sephiroth and Ultimecia. From his design to his cry of defeat.**Music:** It is just enchanting. While every FF has masterful OSTs, FFII has a very mythical and dark theme to its music at the same time. My only issue is that all towns/dungeons/castles shared the same music, but I guess even that was too much for the time. Here are some of my favorites: [Main Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6at4mvCSzcg), [Rebel Army Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eMup-_pJsM), [Ancient Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Z2rvH6A_s), [Town Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOyTTuHgDow) and my favorite, [Castle Pandemonium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uR2W5d8rD0)**World:** Although nowhere near as extensive as the following titles' lore, FFII has its fair share of it. This game encourages talking to NPCs to learn where to go to next, and oftentimes they drop bits of knowledge about the world. The biggest source of information, though, is the Mysidia village. I guess my only complaint about the worldbuilding is that some NPCs have the same lines, or that for some of them their lines do not get updated, which results in the Salamand people still talking to you about Josef's death near the end of the game when in fact it happens much closer to its beginning than end.**Hallmarks:** FFII is the birth of so many hallmarks. Chocobos, Cid, Ultima, Dark Knights, Dragoons, front/back rows, feisty female pirate leaders and more are born with this entry.And finally, let's address the elephant in the room... **THE GAMEPLAY.** As someone who's played through every version of the game, I can say that the original was indeed a rough experience at first. However, all of its issues have been fixed in the subsequent versions. I completed this playthrough of mine without attacking my teammates ONCE. I just played normally and had no issues with advancing. The sky high encounter rates raise your stats in no time so there's that. I appreciate how you can make every character become what you want. I made Firion a paladin analogue, made Maria an Axe wielding black mage, made Guy a white mage/monk hybrid and kept Leon a dark knight, but I could easily make everyone whatever the hell I wanted. Also I appreciate weapons and armor that help you level up certain stats; you can either balance your party or unbalance it even more (I did the latter. Firion had sky high agility/mind, Maria had strength/intelligence, Guy had spirit/strength and Leon had a bit of everything).I also appreciated the password system. It was so much fun asking random people about things they should have no idea about only to realize they indeed have an opinion on the issues you present them with! Kudos to the game for allowing us to get the mythical sword Excalibur if we take the time to reunite Ricard with Kain and his wife and then go back and tell them about his demise. It was a nice little detail.One thing that's very unforgiving is the dungeons. Those things were a pain in the ass! Especially those trick doors that place you in the center of an empty room and almost every step you take is a tougher-than-normal random encounter. I hated those. Still, I think dungeons are not SUPPOSED to be pleasant, so I'd say they did okay with them.And with that, my review of Final Fantasy II comes to an end.To close off, my intention is by no means to change anyone's mind, but to share my very positive experience while playing this controversial game and to spread some love for it. Yes, some things it did were not as good (side-eyeing Leon, some dungeons and the original FFII's battle system) but honestly for a 30-year old game (I mean come on people!) I'd say it did very well for its time, and even that it still holds up today (especially the PSP remake; that one is just enchanting). I highly recommend it. Don't let the hate comments discourage you; I used to do the same, only to find out it's as great an experience as every FF before or after it.",

I'm still fairly new to the game, but was able to hit a few weeks in last season before the assassin update, and was wondering what the general consensus was with him.My thoughts: I think his parkour is ridiculously too strong and I get extremely frustrated every single time I play him. I feel like it gives him such a huge advantage over ALL other players because he basically can run in a straight line making escaping or chasing all but impossible. Even simple basics such as placing a ward near river from over the wall can result in a death or burning summoners just to get very basic vision. I play Xerath a lot against him to try to keep some space from him, and trying to ult him down is crazy difficult because he can just jump a wall and I lose vision on him immediately. Also, his rake is crazy strong as if you get hit by it once you are getting hit by it twice with bonus damage AND a slow. I'd say the last straw for me was hitting him at full range with a Xerath stun, flashed into range of my inhibitor tower, and he was still able to kill me before i made it out of the other side of the range of the tower. That's insane to me. That turned into a little more ranty than I meant, but out of all the re-worked assassins (who I think all got stronger despite it being a fairly intense argument among players), he is by far the most in need of some adjustment before the season starts up again.",

Him and I have been seeing each other for 2 months now. I have never made it this far. I've been on dates with others, but nothing ever worked. I was either not into them, or they weren't into me.This feels like it's going in the relationship direction. He told me I am different and that he thinks I could be the one for him. He has only been in serious relationships, he hates the idea of FWB (so do I). We made it clear that we want a serious relationship. He has been in 2 serious relationships. One for 2 years, another for 7. He wants to settle. He has also told me that he hasn't been seeing anybody else.I was all good up until it hit near the 2 month mark. I'm starting to get anxiety about why he hasn't asked me to be his girlfriend yet. I'm starting to second-guess everything and telling myself negative things, like he's not that into me.Last week was awesome, he surprised me with tickets to the circus during the week, and then on the weekend, we cooked together and watched a movie. So I saw him twice last week.This week I didn't see him at all. I know it's because he is busy with work, but it still gets me down. I asked him to hang out this weekend, but he has to work and has a friend's birthday party.I'm also worried because during the first couple of weeks when we first met, he would text me all of the time. Now he only texts me to make plans.I just want to relax and go with the flow. I noticed when I do this, good things happen. It's like I'm attracting positive things to me. But it is so hard for me. For example, when I had all anxious about him not texting me. He doesn't text.

Don't get me wrong, it starts off amazingly strong, Pop Song 89 is one of the best openers on an R.E.M. album -- I actually prefer the acoustic version because it allows the vocal interplay between Mills and Stipe to show more -- but man after that we just get so much inconsistency, Document wasn't perfect I'll give you that, but it's songs were just boring to me, not objectivley bad. Green is the first R.E.M. album to start having really bad songs on it. Get Up and Stand are some of the most obnoxious tunes I've ever heard, and what's worse is they're being written by one of my favorite bands. They both sound like, if  I didn't know any better, parodies of R.E.M. by a lesser band. \"GET UP, GET UP\" may be one of the most inane refrains I've ever heard in my life.  And then there's The Wrong Child.....man is this a clusterfuck of a song. It embodies everything that R.E.M. would become known for after Bill Berry left; schmaltzy, aimless and corny. The vocals on this are honestly one of the worst I've ever heard, not only on an R.E.M. song but on a song period. Corny, it's just so damn corny. Stand is just incredibly obnoxious hearing Stipe snarly nasally \"STAND\" makes me wanna tear my ears off. It's a testament to Pop Song 89, Orange Crush and I Remember California's greatness that saves this album from being thrown in the garbage. I give it a 5/10, What do you guys think? I know R.E.M. is a sacred cow so please don't crucify me to bad for this haha.",

Also, my bedroom shares a wall with the washer and dryer and it's very loud.  So starting at bedtime means I will be doing the laundry,  or she has to stay up for the whole cycle length, AND I will hear it all.  I told her to do it the next day.Tonight at bedtime again, she says \"I never did my laundry, I'm going to do it now.\"  She has been in a foul mood all day and very rude, using inappropriate language and yelling.  It all goes back to a missing homework assignment and chores that were left undone.  I told her that it's too late to do laundry, and reminded her that she had five hours of free time this afternoon and had skipped all of her chores.  She replied that she only has one pair of pants left upstairs and they are \"painful and uncomfortable\".  After I was firm with my no, she yelled some more and stormed upstairs.  About ten minutes later, she came back down and apologized.  Her attitude wasn't completely better but it was improved.I'm tempted to do her laundry for her tonight since she apologized and needs her stuff washed.  But I also have a tendency to be a pushover.  WWRD?ETA this is a common occurrence, she waits until every single item of clothing is dirty and waits until bedtime.",

That was a big thing to do in the 40's let alone the early 1800's. He also accepted having his \"race\" stripped from him and being known as \"colored\" in the census.

UT is not an option for me as even though i have a 4.0 gpa the prerequisite class i need to get in has been canceled and no longer offered in an ACC campus anymore. I have been accepted into Texas State for the upcoming spring semester but the 50 min commute will limit me to only go twice a week which I dont think will be too good considering clubs and tutoring or office hours for professors. The only thing I am worried about St. Edwards is how their accounting program is.I emailed the director and she told me the Big 4 do recruit from there but I would like to hear from someone who has either graduated from the university or is currently attending. Cost isnt much of an issue since i am actually getting a better financial aid package from St. Edwards than Texas State surprisingly. The main things I am concerned about are if the university gets recruited from. I am obviously going to try my best to get an internship but if i dont I would like to know what y chances are. Since its in Austin I think i should have good opportunities for other jobs as well. Thanks for any advice!",

That being said, is now a good time to start? I definitely have the means to do so, it's just a matter of how important it is to me and THAT depends on how important it really is to my health.

There are two programs I am interested in: one at my campus and one at another.Campus 1 (my campus): The pre-reqs are anatomy and physiology 1-2 and micro along with HESI and immunization stuff (not important). The program involves a lot of standard nursing stuff like pharmacology and nursing skill courses and totals to 19 classes. The courses are really specific too, such as maternal/newborn clinicals and mental health clinicals and even a required course at the end to prepare for the licensure test. The pass rate for the certification test is 85-89%. Total time: 4 semesters plus 2 classes per winter and summer.Campus 2: The pre-reqs are just anatomy and physiology 1-2 but micro is apart of the degree (along with HESI stuff) too. The program requires nursing 10 courses. The pass rate for the certification is in the high 90%. Someone who went there told me that the program was really good too. Total time: the program is 4 semesters but I have enough of it completed to finish it in 2.The certification isn't different at each campus since it is the state's certification. I don't know if Campus 1 would be better knowledge wise for actually working or if Campus 2 is a shortcut that gets me the same result that Campus 1 would. Ultimately, ALL of the hospitals near me require a bachelor's, so I'm going to end up enrolling in my old university for a bachelors in head nursing... so I can satisfy entry-level nursing.

For the weird academic background I eluded to: I was a high school drop out who wound up at community college and got an associates in Medical Laboratory Technology. I then went back to school and earned a BS in Medical Laboratory science. GPA is a ~3.7 for the BS and 3.8 for the Associates. My BS was all online (through Weber State). Not sure how that will effect my chances.  I want to go to grad school because I'm bored with my current job and would like to try research and hopefully eventually teach at a college level.

Like most archetypes, I smashed as many of \"the best\" cards of this effect into one deck and am struggling with the results. **The Commander**+ This started off as a Shattergang deck where I tried to support artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The deck, with a slight reanimator theme, was spread too thin and at some point I realized that it wasn't working how I wanted it to. Shortly after I realized there was some kind of combo involving lands that could be animated into artifact creatures, artifact recursion, and Grave Pact effects.**The Wincons**+ Thespian's Stage + Dark Depths+ Inkmoth Nexus + Forgotten Ancient or Nissa, Vital Force+ Shattergang + Manlands to remove creatures, attack+ Creeping Renaissance + Borborygmos Enraged**The Lands**+ Fetchlands for reshuffle and Crucible of Worlds+ Artifact lands, Buried Ruin for Daretti/Goblin Welder+ Mana lands+ Dryad Arbor, Inkmoth Nexus, Blinkmoth Nexus, Mutavault, Mishra's Factory to animate, enhance, and sacrifice+ Command Beacon,  Bojuka Bog, Homeward Path, Glacial Chasm, High Market, Maze of Ith, Strip Mine, Wasteland, Thespian's Stage, Dark Depths for utility since I want to be searching lands anyway**The Recursion**+ Buried Ruin+ Daretti, Scrap Savant+ Goblin Welder+ Meren of Clan Nel Toth+ Feldon of the Third Path+ Magus of the Will+ Sheoldred, Whispering One+ Titania, Protector of Argoth+ Animate Dead+ Crucible of Worlds+ Life from the Loam+ Nissa, Vital Force+ Scrap Trawler+ Nezumi Graverobber+ Creeping Renaissance**Supporting Land Theme**+ Borborygmos Enraged+ Joiner Adept+ Omnath, Locus of Rage+ Oracle of Mul Daya+ Realm Seekers+ The Gitrog Monster+ Tireless Tracker+ Titania, Protector of Argoth+ Ulvenwald Hydra+ Wood Elves+ Nissa, Vital Force+ Crop Rotation+ Realms Uncharted+ Life from the Loam+ Tempt with Discovery+ Exploration+ Prismatic Omen+ Crucible of Worlds+ Expedition Map+ Chromatic Lantern**Protection/Slow the Game Way Down**+ Boompile+ Oblivion Stone+ Bitterblossom+ Damnation+ Toxic Deluge+ Tragic Slip+ Daretti, Ingenious Iconoclast+ Wurmcoil Engine+ Ulvenwald Hydra+ Steel Hellkite+ Magus of the Abyss+ Kokusho, the Evening Star+ Bloodgift Demon+ Borborygmos Enraged+ Duplicant+ Archfiend of Depravity+ Wasteland+ Strip Mine+ Glacial Chasm**Card Advantage** + Archfiend of Depravity+ Bloodgift Demon+ Borborygmos Enraged+ Harvester of Souls+ Oracle of Mul Daya+ Realm Seekers+ Sheoldred, Whispering One+ The Gitrog Monster+ Tireless Tracker+ Titania, Protector of Argoth+ Treasure Keeper+ Ulvenwald Hydra+ Wood Elves+ Daretti, Scrap Savant+ Realms Uncharted+ Life from the Loam+ Tempt with Discovery+ Sylvan Library+ Elemental Bond+ Sensei's Divining Top+ Mind's Eye+ Expedition Map**The Problem**After seeing this list you might have an idea of what the issues are:+ Some hands without enough mana-producing lands+ Some hands without enough draw/card advantage+ Some hands without enough correct-color-producing landsWhat ends up happening with a mixed bag of results is that the deck does anything it can to stay alive. That seems to be the primary goal, as going for my wincons too early will most likely lead to me sputtering out. At worst I have nothing to play or can't play what I have. Assuming I have a hand of useful spells the deck can pull off a win. Obviously I'm reaching with parts of this deck, but every time I go to remove the Artifact theme or Recursion theme I can't bring myself to do it as it helps the deck in a weird way. A few ideas I've had but have been unable to pull the trigger on:+ Remove Omnath, Locus of Rage. It's one of the harder spells to pay for as if I have 7 mana early it's rarely in the right colors. However being able to pump 5/5s is useful+ Entomb to put Life from the Loam in my graveyard for a more consistent early game+ Phyrexian Altar would be helpful here without a doubt+ Change commander to Prossh. This would give me a 5/5 flier, sac outlet, or 7 creatures with a lot more consistency. Having more consistency here would be really helpful for times when I don't have support in my hands.+ More 5 color lands, even less basics+ A few cards that seem to be less useful but are still hard to remove. + Do I run Amulet of Vigor? I prioritized Exploration but even that effect isn't useful all of the time, just when I'm \"going off\"I don't think I'll be able to make the deck perfect but I know I can streamline it more, and I think the concept is worth doing right. I'll do my best to answer any questions.http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/hooked-on-the-brothas-copy/",

Currently, I fight in Battleships exclusively (350 Battles/296 BB/175+ USN BB) and I know that in the long run, this is a detriment to myself. So, I'm here to ask the WoWS community for help on what tech trees I should focus on for Cruisers and Destroyers. I'm not too interested in Carrier combat but I have heard USN Carriers, far and away, outmatch IJN Carriers.My only real requirement for any ships I use is they're not Premium and that I want to hit what I'm aiming at. This is why I drive USN Battleships over IJN Battleships (Currently T6 in a New Mexico).While the USN guns may be smaller and have poorer range, my accuracy with them is much better. I stopped playing the IJN Battleship line soon after reaching the Kongo where no matter how well I aimed, the spread of rounds went over the ship or hit the water short of the ship. When I did hit, I did good damage but I'd rather get the hits and whittle away at an enemy's health, not sit and think every salvo \"If that did hit...\" if you know what I mean.Anyways, aside from Battleships unless someone would like to enlighten me on those as well, what nations would you consider for Destroyers and Cruisers and why I should focus on that nation's line?I'm trying my best to improve myself in this game and I would like to hear how other players think regarding this.",

A letter was sent home first and some parents opted out of their child being part of the lesson. I'm a very open-minded person, but I honestly can't for the life of me figure out why someone wouldn't want their kid knowing that some people have two dads and some have two moms. It really didn't go beyond that. Also, the kids weren't fazed at all. It was just like any other diversity/Martin Luther King/respect everyone type of talk to them. Anybody ever had a similar situation or have any ideas about why some parents are so against their kids knowing this stuff at this point in history? If this was 20 years ago, I could understand a bit more why it could be controversial .",

For the rest of you, we have the AskMen awards!We tallied all your votes (just kidding) and we came up with stupid categories to fake nominate posts for so that we could show you all just how much better we are than you because we can highlight our names in bold green letters and you can't. So without further ado, here are the categories and winners of a poll you never did nor asked for!!**CATEGORY 1: BIGGEST SHITLORD**Due to some random rule we made up that says you can't win the same award two years in a row, the title of biggest shitlord passes from /u/CardinalsFanatic to **/u/RampagingKoala**, in all of his tall, white, affluent glory.  Praise be to him, the biggest shitlord.**CATEGORY 2: BEST THREAD CREATOR**I actually did some research for this one.  For his varied contributions to threads and posts, the winner is **/u/Not_A_Unique_Name**.  Congratulations and I'm hoping you don't do something stupid and get yourself banned.**CATEGORY 3: BEST MEME**I'm gonna go with [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5bjv8p/big_guys_of_askmen_what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of/) because it actually gave us a new flair for the sub.  So thanks guys.  The Fire Rises.**CATEGORY 4: BEST MOD**Since we mathematically proved this earlier in the year, **/u/BetweenTwoWords** takes home this title.  Sig Heil.**CATEGORY 5: WORST MOD**We have a tie between **/u/baseball44121** and **/u/RealQuickPoint** for literally doing nothing.  LITERALLY DOING NOTHING. **SIDE CATEGORY: BIGGEST JEW MOD**Because /u/RampagingKoala won last year, this honor goes to **(((/u/Dajbman22)))**.**CATEGORY 6: BEST FEMALE POSTER**Congrats to **/u/orangepeeling** for commenting enough for me actually being able to remember you. **CATEGORY 7: FUNNIEST THREAD**That award goes to [this thread where OP asks whether or not his girlfriend is trying to season him with cracked pepper shower gel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4r1sqx/girlfriend_bought_me_ginseng_and_cracked_pepper/)**CATEGORY 8: BEST COMMENT**Congrats to **/u/Compromissionary** for [this destruction of human life](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4biemc/wanna_play_the_how_filthy_can_we_make_this_thread/d19d90u/)**CATEGORY 9: MOST INTERESTING SUBMISSION**Congrats to **/u/ElvisShrugged** for [this thread on whether or not he should upgrade his finger guns from single to double barrel, which generated quite a large amount of reports for the shitpost that it was](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4szgqj/what_are_the_pros_amd_cons_of_upgrading_my_finger/)**CATEGORY 10: MOST PROLIFIC COMMENTER**This one is difficult because it meant finding someone who commented enough but wasn't a total twat, so actual research was done to award Most Prolific Commenter to **/u/PacSan300**.**CATEGORY 11: FAVORITE COMMENTER****/u/KingEsoteric** lives up to his tag as an \"Actual Poster\" by actually posting advice and not being a total tool.**CATEGORY 12: MOST HELPFUL USER****/u/Goatsonice** wins for contributing nothing but attempting to shit talk me in every thread he posts in.  Congrats buddy.**CATEGORY 13: BEST REACTION IMAGE**Attempting to weed out all of my weeb shit, [this image](http://i.imgur.com/qj3jk7Y.png) takes home the best reaction image award.**CATEGORY 14: BEST BODY****/u/mashonem**.  Honorable mention to /u/Fletch71011.**CATEGORY 15: BIGGEST TROLL**/u/UnstableFlux.  Just leave already, man.  It's getting to be too much.**CATEGORY 16: WORST USER**Like Time Magazine, we're lazy and can't come up with a winner.  So the winner is all of you.  You all suck.  We hate you so goddamn much.**CATEGORY 17: WORST FEMALE USER**We have made a special exception for this category, and \"every woman ever\" wins Wosrt Female User again because as we all know, women are money-grubbing whores only interested in Chad and taking his beefy Chad dick and screwing over nice guys like us REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**CATEGORY 18: BEST FOREIGNER**~~Because /u/bfg24 left the mod team because he's a pussy, **/u/BetweenTwoWords** wins again by default.~~ Russia hacked the awards voting, and **/u/nickachu_** wins Best Foreigner.  Because /u/BetweenTwoWords can't win twice in a row. Canada still doesn't count as a separate country.  **CATEGORY 19: BEST TOKEN BLACK MOD****/u/Dajbman22**.  Because he's Indian.**CATEGORY 20: BEST EYELASHES****/u/runningblack**.  Because I don't know, he asked to win this award.  I'll let him explain it.  He does have really nice eyelashes though.To all the winners: Your awards for being the absolute worst pieces of filth in humanity can be picked up at my place. They're located in my ass, and the only way to get them out is to eat it. That way, you'll feel as shitty as you would if you had posted in this good-for-nothing sub with all its good-for-nothing losers who post here.I say this from the bottom of my heart, you are the scum of humanity and you should all feel ashamed for existing and even worse for posting in this sub. We should probably just be banned from reddit entirely and have our IPs blacklisted by the NSA. Fuck you, fuck your mothers, and I know you will all have horrible new year filled with misery. I know this because even through all the absolutely horrible shitty content, you still come crawling back to this sub because deep down, you like reading this shit.",

(okay I'm exaggerating but you know how some people want more than what is realistic, I had to reign that mindset in). In the end we got an approximately $26k wedding. I tried to keep track of all the purchases but you lose reciepts and have to make ballpark guesses on things so a good amount of the smaller numbers here are just approximate costsI should note that my wifes Dad paid for the photography/video, my wifes mom paid for the entertainment (duelling pianos). My parents did the rehearsal dinner, the alcohol, and the honeymoon (except for excursions, which cost more than I would have thought...) So overall cost is estimated 26k but me and my wifes costs were closer to $18.5k. [Heres a screen shot of my spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/lKm6P).Few things to note: originally her rings were cheaper but she has a nickel allergy so we had to swap it out for platinum. I originally got her a 3 diamond ring and she loved it so unfortunately I didn't feel right downgrading to a solitaire in order to make up the cost of platinum. So the rings got pricier than I would have liked.The reception site was a wood cabin style lodge in a county park. Rental was 800/day. I wish we would have just done one day but I was persuaded on doing two days so we could set up tables and decorations on the day before the wedding and have the rehearsal there as well. The flowers for the ceremony/reception are real flowers for centerpieces and corsages and what not. The bouquets are separate on the spreadsheet because they were ordered from a company that makes them from wood. The looked very nice and they make good artsy decorations for peoples homes.We ordered the cake through a grocery store. Pretty inexpensive. Then we ordered extra sheet cakes in case we ran out. We definitely didn't run out. Never even touched the sheet cake. But I recommend ordering through grocery stores. The cake was really pretty and was much cheaper than what a fancy bakery would charge.Invitations: I suggest not paying for save the dates and rsvp cards and all that crap because if people want to come they'll come without forgetting. Send invitations early enough and they'll throw them on their fridge with a magnet as a reminder. Don't buy RSVP cards because people suck at rsvping no matter what, you're going to have to make calls. So save yourself some cash.Liquor was super cheap because we hired this liquor store/bar that will bartend events. They already own all the alcohol so you just pay a standard travel/bartending fee and then they tally up whatever you use, and the next day they run your card.Overall I had a killer time but this shit is expensive as all get out and I'm glad I'm only doing it once. Have a look at the spreadsheet, hopefully this can give some people some ideas on what certain things cost.",

Yeah I'm not known as an Alpha but I'm not entirely Beta either. Anyway thankfully, only *very few* people from my old school went to the same university as me. All acquintances, not friends.Well, there is one girl in particular who I was merely an acquintance with.

This above incident actually happened a while ago, but whenever I see this girl around uni (which isn't that much), I feel quite intimidated, and I don't know why. She was clearly in disgust, as she probably still saw me as that omega. My theory is that I don't see myself capable of becoming an Alpha, a real transformed Alpha wouldn't give a shit, in a twisted sort of way, I see myself as just a \"poser\" - I feel as if I am just pretending.

I figured the workweek was over, we had a good week for the most part, he had some cool things planned just for him, that surely we would see some action in the bedroom, especially since he'd put me off with \"tomorrow\" a few times in a row.  I promised myself I wouldn't ask- because I didn't want to pressure him and because the rejection was too painful.  Of course, I failed, and we had two major fights about sex and there was no sex.  He said I was a bitch and that hounding him and being mean turns him off.  I really wasn't trying to do any of that.  I told him it was shared responsibility at the least, because he had been disengaged and an asshole.  I dropped the subject, told him I want peace and love him and he asked me if I wanted to call it all off because my needs weren't met.  He was pretty fair about it at this point.  He said he wants me to be happy.  I told him I want him, and I want peace, but that I also want to be desired and not turned down so much.  But that I choose him.  He watched a movie of my choosing and we went to bed.  Whatever I said must have been meaningful, because the next morning (Sunday), he was a whole new man.  I didn't ask for a thing and got royally fucked (in the good way) three times yesterday.  He was grinning from ear to ear all day, and woke up really happy this morning.  I know he holds plenty of responsibility for our situation, but so do I.  I have got to be more easygoing without being a doormat.  I may have been cockblocking myself this whole time.  He seems open to whatever will makeme happy, and I'm looking forward to when we finally start therapy so we can work out the kinks.  I don't think yesterday will be an every day occurrence but it sure was nice and I feel like our talk helped us turn a corner.",

One in particular offers $200 bonus after spending $3,000 in 3 months, and a few others I had my eye on are like $150 bonuses.My question is, how would applying for, say 3 of these cards affect my score you think? My biggest concern is my average age would drop, however, my utilization would also drop significantly after the 3 months, would these two factors balance out? Assuming I could actually spend the required amounts in the allotted time to qualify for the bonuses, and pay it back in 3 months, would this be worth the $500 or so in bonuses?",

Do you think anyone will become fluent after reading all the chapters? Even in high school French with two lessons a week it took two years before we got to the past tense.

The more time goes by, the harder it becomes to find people I enjoy being around. Even many old friends I’ve had since school have become less tolerable, and I find myself slowly steeping back from their company.It just seems like I don’t meet many people who get me or the big picture (or at least my idea of it) or what’s important. People complain about such trivial things and I can’t help but say, “You’re focusing on all the wrong things here. *This* is what really matters.”I mean not to be rude or press my beliefs on others, I just can’t handle when people can’t see optimism in life, or the beauty in what they have, or how important the gift of life is.The only people that seem to get my ideology at all is people who have had to face their mortality; people who have experienced the worst life has to offer. Because these are the people that, usually, can see that by experiencing the worst, we gain a clear perspective on THE BEST life has to offer. For me, just being here is one of the best things of all. I may not have a lot of money in my pocket (or anywhere), but at least I’m not breaking my back 60 hours a week to make money I’ll never have time to spend, while other people are banking millions off me.I have happiness. I have family. Friends. Occasionally, even women that find me desirable (Not that I’m even remotely interested in 99% of the). I have a dog, and we have a roof and four walls, and a bed to sleep in. I have soccer balls, and trees I can kick it between. But most importantly, I have my health. And as long as I have these things, you will not hear me complaining. As long as I have even a few of these things, I will always have happiness.But I fear I will also always be misunderstood by most, because my happiness is not the same thing as their happiness. I’m not saying the grass is greener on my side, but I sure do prefer it.",

We live on the second floor, and there's even been a recently built attachment added on to the back with 3 new apartments. My electricity bill has been insane lately - illogical. He's at work all day, I'm at school and/or work all day, we're good with shutting things off and unplugging them, he unfortunately has a desktop (I have a laptop) which I'm sure is using a decent amount of energy (we're both gamers so our computers are on a lot), but still, the amount of supposed electricity use is illogical. I think the landlord either is wiring the heating into our apartment (he's supposed to pay for heating according to the lease, and we've noticed a huge spike in our bill during the winter months when the heating's on), or he's incorrectly wired another apartment into ours when they were redoing the house's electricity to split it into apartments. I think his son did the work (the son's an electrician). The hydro company uses smart meters that electronically send them our usage data, and we had to ask the landlord to show us these meters because they're locked away. Our landlord is normally a very nice man, but he was a bit angry/rushed when showing us the meters... pretty fishy behavior for him.

It's equipped with a 430 and after starting it up and punching through the usual startup messages it said the databases we're either lost or out of date. Sorry idr I was just ridding along with someone who wanted to take it out for a taxi and make sure it wasn't going to die in the hangar.Either way, my question is can you override the database message and still use it even though it is out of date? I know you can't legally use it for RNAV/IAPs and the like, but just as a backup for VFR situational awareness can you set it up with outdated data. I've tried searching online and through the manual but of course they want you to keep it updated. And if you do chose to update it (or are forced to to use it), does anyone know the difference between the one time upgrade and the subscription option from [Garmin](https://fly.garmin.com/fly-garmin/support/pricing)? I can't find any info if it is only for 6 calendar months, til end of year, or otherwise. Thanks! - Curious young pilot.",

I have kept big dogs (malamutes, German Shepherds, Labradors, Newfoundlands) my whole life and am drawn to give this breed a try.  We are not looking to breed or show. Just a family pet. The personality, size, and appearance are all a draw but all anyone talks about with this breed is grooming requirements. What is your experience? Do you spend 3 to 4 hours a week brushing? Is keeping them in a puppy cut practical? Do they shed year round or seasonally like malamutes?Any real life experience would be appreciated. ",

Then, while printing a rather large object, the X axis started freezing. I was only an hour into the print, out of 11 hours. It was just printing the base.    Now, I can't even start a print. It goes into leveling and freezes as soon as it moves the X axis.     That being said, I can calibrate and move the X axis without any issues. The belt was very tight and I loosened it up two notches to see if that was the problem. I also made sure the motor and X axis pulley moved freely (without power).   I've tried stock prints from the SD card that Prusa sent with the printer, as well as STL's I got off thingiverse. It just quits as soon as it tries to use the X axis.   A fellow on the Prusa Google Hangouts suggested trying to run a Sample Code [HERE](https://github.com/Apsu/gcode/blob/master/sample.gcode) but, I do not know how to run this.      EDIT; For the fellow that will one day google this and not find an answer, I found my solution. I was in **LOW POWER/SILENT MODE** and as soon as I put it back in **HIGH POWER** mode, it was printing fine.",

However we've known each other for at least eight years now.She gives me rides home, we hang out outside of school, play DnD together. All the stuff I'm gonna talk about has just come up naturally in conversation, I'm not interrogating her for information.In the last two-three weeks she seems to have changed a lot, or is at least more comfortable being herself with me. For example she told me that she had smoked weed \"two or three\" times but in the last two weeks or so she has found a dealer at her work. Now she talks about weed really frequently and seems to becoming a stereotypical \"stoner\".She also smokes a lot of cigarettes. She tried to tell me she only smokes when she's stressed, or to relax, and it's only like three cigarettes a day. However I could tell she's full of it. Any time she's not around her other friends she is smoking.She seems to submit to peer pressure really easily and is really non-confrontational. Her coworkers made fun of her for not having piercings so she went and got her nipples and septum pierced. She dated a guy who smoked weed and tobacco and now she does too. I don't care that she smokes weed or tobacco. It only bugs me because it makes me kind of uncomfortable and it seems like that's all she talks about.Basically I'm just worried about her. She seems to be spiraling. She's got no motivation to finish school, hates her parents, and is falling in with a bad crowd. I've only recently got my life back on track and I don't want to get sucked into the same stuff as her. Is there anything I should be doing to help her or should I just let her do what she's gotta do? She's one of my closest friends now and I'm worried about her.TL;DR My friend is making some bad decisions and I'm not sure what to do.---   ",

Scout's honor, none but a few of the jars have more than two bowls taken out of them.  The ones that do will be shipped to the first few buyers for free.I ask for $8 a jar + shipment costs.  Most are worth more, and some are worth less.  Your package will arrive with the tobacco in the jar, and the tin that goes along with it if desired.

The Caramel Rush and Bourbon Whiskey are mostly gone, The Honey &amp; Chocolate has about a 3/4 tin worth, and the English Chocolate and Alsbo Gold each have three bowls out of them.Here is the list of tobaccos:4th Generation - 1897 Erik Paul's Blend~~*Alsbo - Gold~~Ashton - Artisan's Blend*Borkum Riff - Bourbon Whiskey~~CAO - Eileen's Dream~~Cornell &amp; Diehl, Inc. - Mississippi MudDrew Estate - 7th Avenue BlondeDrew Estate - Central Park Stroll~~Drew Estate - Meat Pie~~~~Dunhill - Royal Yacht~~~~Dunhill - Nightcap~~~~James Normon Ltd. - Earl Baldwin's Presbyterian~~~~Erinmore Flake~~Hearth &amp; Home - Manor Heights~~*Mac Baren - Honey &amp; Chocolate~~Mastro de Paja - VeneziaMcClelland - Blue Mountain~~*McClelland - Caramel Rush~~~~McClelland - Chocolate Silk~~~~McClelland - Frog Morton's Cellar~~~~Orlik - Golden Sliced~~~~Peterson - Nutty Cut~~Peterson - Sunset Breeze~~Peterson - Sweet Killarney~~Peterson - University FlakeSasieni - Balkan MixtureSkandinavik - Full Aroma~~The Smoker - New York, New York~~~~The Smoker - Wise Fox~~Sutliff - Molto DolceTroost - Aromatic Cavendish~~Two Friends (Cornell &amp; Diehl, Inc.) - Celtic Mist~~~~*Two Friends (Cornell &amp; Diehl, Inc.) - English Chocolate~~W.O.

If you buy enough tobacco to fill more than just one box, we'll call shipping $25 for two boxes, and $30 for three.~~I'll cross tins off the list as they are taken by you awesome folks.I have never had an experience with /r/pipetobaccomarket, but you guys are friggen awesome...so this post will stay here for a few days, then transferred there if not all tins are sold.  If you have friends over in PTM, they are welcome to come here.**EDIT**:  Shipping can be as low as $6 if you do not want the jar.  I will empty the tobacco in a plastic bag and ship it via padded envelope.~~All things will be shipped the following day receiving payment, unless payment is made before noon that day.

		"text": "It's true that [Meat Pie](http://i.imgur.com/2q7flrS.jpg) by Drew Estate is nothing as novel or remarkable as a 3D printer...definitely not as pleasurable as sex...and you may have tasted a better English tobacco.  So, why in the world would I ask you to try this seemingly unremarkable blend?  I'll give you my honest review, but I'm not going to give you a 1-10 rating system.  My tastes differ from yours and, thus, it renders the numbers completely worthless and arbitrary.Firstly, I would like to commend how this tobacco burns.  I paid no special attention to packing this tobacco, and after the initial charring burn and re-pack and re-light...I didn't need to touch it with my lighter at all for the rest of the smoke.  A pleasant 'dafuq' escaped my lips as I am not an overly seasoned smoker, but I can tell the difference between Latakia and Virginia :P.  The burn was even all the way to the bottom, and tamping occasionally was satisfying in the sense that it didn't feel like I was packing concrete.  The smoke was the perfect temperature, it wasn't so cool that I thought I was chewing an Altoid, and it wasn't so hot that I thought I was inhaling a ghost pepper.  Imagine a fresh cup of hot chocolate with some whipped cream on top that had cooled for a minute.  In fact, puffing on it lightly or heavily didn't change its temperature.  My conclusion on how to smoke it, as log as you aren't hooking the mouthpiece up to the air intake of a formula 1 car, you won't turn the tobacco into lava.  It was everything I could have wanted in a smoking experience on a strictly incendiary level.The complexity of the flavor of Meat Pie is about as complex as a preschooler drawing.  You may not see whatever the fuck that kid was trying to draw, but in the end, it's just that kid and his parents holding hands on a hill underneath a tree on a sunny day.  The beginning of the bowl is mild.  So very, very mild.  In fact, for you English-lovers, you may be tempted to throw a small hickory twig and some pepper in your bowl to add that \"kick\" you so very, very want from a latakia blend.  On a scale of 1 to Nightcap, this tobacco is around .9 AT THE BEGINNING.  I'll get to the pre-dottle burn at the end of this review, trust me...WORTH IT.  Anyway, as far as English blends go, Meat Pie is turning out to be pretty mild.  Personally, I really like that.  Even though I like the taste of English blends, I'd rather not be sent to the moon on the fuel of the flavor.  Like I said, I really enjoy how mild it is, but to the addict craving for that next English fix...you might be disappointed.  I recommend exhaling through the nose, it completes the feeling.  You know the difference between a meh orgasm, and the one that tingles up through your toes and sends electric shocks through your entire pelvic region?  Well, breathing through your nose isn't THAT incredible, but it adds  icing to the cake.Room note: Holy fuck.  In a good way.  To me, burning English tobacco is within the realms of snorting exhaust while snacking on baby shit.  The room note on Meat Pie is EXCEEDINGLY mild, even when burning through the more flavorful pre-dottle.  FINALLY, an English that I can smoke around...dare I say it...NON SMOKERS.  Seriously, the room note is something you have to smell for yourself before you think I'm lying.  Although I may be exaggerating my pleasant experience a little bit for the lolz of you guys, I'm serious when I say that this is an English worth trying if only for the novelty of enjoying it around others and not being chased away via pitchforks.Smoke production is adequate.  It is thick, but not voluminous.  Nothing too special here, a very white smoke.  Yada yada.Nicotine hit is along the lines of an average burley blend.  It won't knock you on your ass, but you'll feel it.And finally, the climax of this tobacco.  The bottom-bowl homestretch.  I am going to be modest about this part because I want you to discover it for yourself, but trust me...it's good.  The peppery latakia finally takes center-stage as you would expect and desire, and some other flavor notes come to play that you wouldn't expect.  A slightly nutty and fruity undertone comes in along with a very subtle, yet appropriate coffee taste, and it is wonderful.Final analysis:  This blend is unremarkable and even mild until the end, where it becomes fantastically flavorful and unique as compared to other Englishes.  The mild room-note even when burning through the full-flavored home-stretch makes this tobacco a worthwhile blend.  You don't have to cater this blend like a newborn, it will take care of itself, and in return, take care of you.  The fact that you can puff on this sucker at YOUR pace versus having to worry about charring and burning your brain through your eyes is refreshing, at least to me.  This English blend would be good for an all-day smoke that won't offend many.  It isn't spectacular enough for me to save for a rainy day or a celebration, but it is good enough for me to write 5,053 character revew.EDIT:  If you like the review, let me know!  I'll do some more with the same kind of humor if you guys like it, if there is anything specific that you wish for me to add for this or future reviews in terms of specs, let me know!",

A few examples:* Tasigur Control that just wants to live long enough to Lab Maniac with only one or two ways to mill myself in large quantities* list http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/the-bananastandman/* Zedruu doing what Zedruu does and giving away things and drawing cards. I don't think the deck has an early game presence strong enough for a Felidar Guardian wincon. My tappedoutlist is out of date but I used to use flying/vigilance creatures to get past this until I realized the mana curve of the deck was too high and it was spending too much time doing not-Zedruu things.* http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/zedruu-is-kind-of-a-dick/I've taken the route of using a control shell for these decks to let other players duke it out, counter things unproductive to me, and then try and focus my energies on my final opponent by either stealing their big things or removing them. This wins...sometimes...but it usually does nothing except make the game last needlessly long. I like control up to a point, but I have to admit I'm spending more time not-dying than i am spending winning, and it's been making it difficult to finish a game in a reasonable amount of time on a weeknight.Have you had decks with no win cons or limited? How did you handle it? Does the deck still exist? What changes did you make, if anything? Do you like or dislike long games where wraths occur and game-winning spells are countered? Finally, do you have experience with Zedruu or Tasigur and have you seen similar situations?This is less about deck help and more discussion, but for reference my playgroup is somewhere between casual-casual-competitive. We don't take things too seriously but some solid 30-50 dollar cards are being played. I'm willing to make changes to the deck as long as I like the change and it fits the direction I want to go with the deck. No house rules.

If not, I will have to take points away from you on Class Dojo and tell Mom and Dad.\" However, she always chooses the latter option which leads to a very frustrated class session with her. This \"Shut Down\" Mode lasts a long time, so I can't reason with her. The next day though I will tell her that she can't do that and needs to listen and be respectful, and she will nod and say okay.

Once Vivek and co. took ownership, we finally had hope. We thought we could see a light at the end of the tunnel. What was in that light? Rudy Gay, DeMarcus Cousins, Mike Malone. Our beloved coach was unreasonably fired and the season turned to complete shit. No one wanted to play, no one wanted to support the team. Attendance dropped drastically. But then we hired George Karl to lead us to victory and respark fan interest. He is supposed to be the one to lead us to the promised land that is the playoffs, fuck, even a .500 record. And now this evening I learn that the man who we all thought was gonna be our coaching savior wants to trade our all star player, the best center in the league, the guy who was going to turn this team, this city, and this franchise around??? FUCK this team KILLS me. If we trade DeMarcus, I don't know if I'll be able to continue being a Sacramento Kings fan. Every time we do something right, they find a way to screw it up. No team in the NBA has this much instability. Like seriously, who the fuck would want to play here? Who wants to get involved with all this drama? If Cousins wasn't safe enough here and was traded, how do any other players know they'll be safe here? If any one involved with the Kings reads this somehow, for the love of god, do NOT trade DMC, unless you want that brand new arena next year to be empty. I am sick and tired of hoping it will be different each year. That all being said, Cousins is still a King so they have my full support. But if he is traded, you can expect attendance numbers to drop, STH's to drop, and it will all be very bad for the Kings...",

On a student budget in a town with no large supermarkets, we have sort of managed a very desperate attempt at American food but have some questions:We couldn't find ravioli so we got tortellini and are going to bread and bake this? Is this acceptable? Because breeding pasta is very confusing for me and the scale of acceptability has already gone out of the window.We are making ooey gooey buttery cake. This is essentially a cake with a cheesecake baked in? Is it possible to make the night before and chill it?We also got some thin crust pizzas. Can we flatten these once defrosted to make them more St Louis like?We got hotdogs, but only have burger buns. We also couldn't afford burgers. Can we compromise and have hot dog burgers?We got French fries and barbecue powder. Can we combine the two to make the sum more American than the Americanness of the parts?Are you supposed to add cheese to Kraft Mac and cheese because there doesn't appear to be any cheese in the box?Many thanks.Edit: [pics](https://imgur.com/a/bwL4X)",

Apparently, I'm not doing as well as I should be by now, which isn't really surprise to me. I try but there is still a disconnect because I don't come from a buying background and I think I basically never learned the foundation of it before jumping right into an associate role, where I am now. My issue is I was given a choice of either going through an improvement plan where we set goals for me and I have to achieve/excel in them for a month/2 months or I may get terminated. Or the other option is tell my boss it's not for me and they'll help me find another job if they can. Now I really like my job but I think the disconnect is that I jumped into it skipping the assistant level so that means I'm essentially where an assistant/coordinator should be right now. I don't want to tell my boss this because it's just kinda...shitty. I came from an analytics background (even then, I barely did anything at my last job because there was no work being given to me). I'm considering taking the improvement plan because it will probably help me if they set actual goals for me that I know I need to achieve. But on the other hand, I also don't want to be out of a job. I would consider trying to jump into planning if this doesn't work out, hopefully move internally. Anyone have insight into this? Any tips you guys have? Especially if you've been in this position before as well would be helpful.

They were discussing moving in together in January - meanwhile, she renewed the lease with her other boyfriend, so we think she never actually intended to move out.Now my friend is upset and wants his money back. I don't think he has a case because all that money was always presented to her as a gift, not a loan. He, on the other hand, feels that he was scammed into giving her gifts and money - that she was only pretending to be his girlfriend to take advantage of him. She lied about a lot of stuff, including her living situation (and being single), her financial situation, her family, etc.Does he have legal grounds against her? Would he have to prove that she was acting or lying? Should he just forget about his money and move on?Thank you so much in advance!",

The pay is not bad ($40k/year) and the benefits are pretty great - 3 weeks vacation/year, they pay 80% of my insurance(medical, vision, dental) and they match 25% of the first 6% I contribute to my 401k.To supplement my income, I have been editing podcasts on the side for a company as a sub contractor for a little over a year.  After finally meeting the owners last month, they offered me a position out of no where.  I don't want to get too deep into the details of the position publicly, but it would be more of a communication/management position that would allow me to work from home. I know I need to ask a LOT of questions.  I could be pulled away from my current position because it is extremely boring, unfulfilling, long hours and I do not foresee any chance of a substantial raise/promotion in the company any time soon.  I'm highly valued here, but due to new government regulation, the company is in a bit of a bad spot.  However, it's a standard W-2 tax situation with great benefits and I love my boss even if I actually do not like the company and it's owners.

So for the first 18 years of life, I never had to \"learn\" how to stay fit. It was as simple as breathing. Then, as a very young adult, I started gaining weight, most notably the freshman 15 in college. That was 12 years ago, and since then I never got that weight off. I would eat better and exercise, but it only lasted for a short while and then I couldn't keep up with it anymore.From about ages 19-29 I was basically 15 or so pounds overweight and it didn't fluctuate so it was kind of like the new normal and I just got used to it.Then at 29 I moved to a new place and started my career, and since then, my weight just piled on for seemingly no reason. I'm now 15-20 pounds OVER my original 15 pounds too much, so now not many of my clothes fit, and it makes me want to cry thinking about having to go shopping for even bigger clothes. I've tried WW before, and like usual, it worked for a few days and then I couldn't stick with it anymore. I'm willing to try again though since it does seem like the best choice out there.I just don't understand why I can't stick with any sort of plan to lose weight. Not to brag, but I've been through some traumatic and very difficult challenges and made it through them with flying colors. This is the one area I can't use my iron will to charge through and succeed. I don't get it. So, if you have a similar story or any ideas, let me know. Thanks!",

Also, I personally prefer bleeps even though I don't have an issue with people swearing.Anyways, Season 5 recently released and its no longer censored. We were rather surprised at the first episode when we started hearing the F-Bomb dropped several times. Don't want the younger ones to be bombarded with guys swearing like, well, truckers. Is there really any point in requesting shows have a censored option? What are the odds of Netflix actually doing anything? All I could really find was a live chat option, no actual suggestion area on their site. So don't feel like wasting time if they don't do anything.",

We've been together for 2 years and I fucking love him, but he's all I consider for a support system right now and he's not fucking there.  I finally lost it, I said fuck it we need to just break up.  His response was \"ok\".    I've always wanted to kill myself but I've always been a fucking coward.

Lately I had been beating myself up for not being some uber-suave slayer, and berated myself for it. But then I realized where I was before RP a year ago:- A fat socially anxious neckbeard with almost no social skillsSince then I have:- Lost 60lbs and am continuing to lose weight- Conquered social anxiety- Become more social and less self hatingI also:- Against all odds from having poor grades and being made fun of school for poor grades, managed to work my ass off and get into a prestigious and respected University degree- Pretty much knocked Chron's disease into remissionAnd I love myself for it. Am I satisfied and now comfortable? No, I'll keep pushing forward, but don't beat yourself up for not being some idealized version of yourself. Accept that YOU have improved.

Cool, but it's still just a thought.Writing a book? Cool, but it's still just a thought.Maintaining a meditation discipline? Cool, but it's still just a thought and, like the others, probably won't get done.I can think endlessly about what I want to do, or tell myself that I want to do, and nothing will happen on the outside unless I live my life by a clear plan.Months ago, I did. There were several consistent days where I would make task blocks in a moleskine notebook, check off what gets done, and surprise, I felt far less stressed and more at ease. Ever since falling out of practice, my life has once again entered a rut.Yet still, I am having trouble coming to terms with the reality that I'm going to need to live life in this way. If I don't track my money, I'll overspend on frivolous items. If I don't put exercise in my agenda, then it's not going to happen unless I desire it in the same way I desire hedonism.",

Seriously though, the last thing that priest needed was MORE ANSWERS to things.  I just don't understand the thinking behind that card, especially right now.  They have a 1 shot combo, an amazing answer to everything except 4 attack minions (which arent really threats in this meta anyway), the ability to steal deathrattles, insane amounts of healing, the Kazakas (arguably strongest single card in the game for decks it fits into other than patches), two silences, one that's 0 mana and the other that silences a whole board and draws a card (in a meta where silence is an extremely valuable tech and a deck that needs cycle).I know this stuff is all obvious and known, but it's just kinda like...why did that deck need a perfect board clear that deals with any board whatsoever under any circumstance while simultaneous destroying a cycle deck's card draw?",
